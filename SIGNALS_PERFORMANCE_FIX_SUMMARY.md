# Signals Performance Fix - Quick Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to Test  
**Expected Improvement:** 83-90% faster (from 5-10s to 0.5-1.5s)

---

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The Signals tab was making **100+ database queries** per request due to an N+1 query problem:
- Loop through 50 signals
- For each signal: fetch narratives (50 queries) + fetch 20 articles (50 queries)
- Total: 100+ queries = 5-10 second load time

### The Solution
Optimized to use **3 batch queries** instead:
1. Fetch all 50 trending entities (1 query)
2. Batch fetch all narratives for all entities (1 query)
3. Batch fetch all articles for all entities (1 query)

---

## Files Changed

### Backend
- **`src/crypto_news_aggregator/api/v1/endpoints/signals.py`**
  - Added `get_recent_articles_batch()` function for batch article fetching
  - Refactored endpoint to use batch operations
  - Added performance logging and metrics
  - Reduced articles per signal from 20 ‚Üí 5

### Frontend
- **`context-owl-ui/src/pages/Signals.tsx`**
  - Added `console.time/timeEnd` for request timing
  - Added logging for response size and signal count

### Documentation
- **`SIGNALS_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md`** - Detailed analysis and testing guide
- **`SIGNALS_PERFORMANCE_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This file
- **`scripts/test_signals_performance.py`** - Performance testing script

---

## How to Test

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Start the server
poetry run python -m uvicorn src.crypto_news_aggregator.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, run the test script
python scripts/test_signals_performance.py

# Or test manually with curl
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/signals/trending?limit=50&timeframe=7d" | jq '.performance'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "total_time_seconds": 0.847,
  "query_count": 3,
  "payload_size_kb": 67.42
}
```

### 2. Frontend Testing

1. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Navigate to Signals tab
3. Check browser console for timing:
   ```
   [Signals] API Request (7d): 1234ms
   [Signals] Response: { signalCount: 50, payloadSize: "67.42 KB", timeframe: "7d" }
   ```

### 3. Railway Testing (After Deploy)

Check Railway logs for performance metrics:
```
[Signals] Fetched 50 trending entities in 0.234s
[Signals] Batch fetched 15 narratives in 0.087s
[Signals] Batch fetched 142 articles for 50 entities in 0.456s
[Signals] Total request time: 0.847s, Queries: 3, Payload: 67.42KB
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Create feature branch**: `fix/signals-performance-optimization`
- [ ] **Test locally** (run test script above)
- [ ] **Commit changes** with descriptive message
- [ ] **Push and create PR**
- [ ] **Test in Railway after merge**
- [ ] **Monitor logs for performance metrics**

---

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Database Queries | 100+ | 3 | ‚úÖ 3 |
| Backend Time | 5-10s | 0.5-1.5s | ‚úÖ < 2s |
| Payload Size | 200-300 KB | 50-100 KB | ‚úÖ < 100 KB |
| Total Load Time | 5-10s | 0.6-1.8s | ‚úÖ < 2s |

---

## Key Optimizations

1. **Batch Queries** - Eliminated N+1 problem
2. **Reduced Article Count** - 20 ‚Üí 5 articles per signal
3. **Performance Logging** - Added comprehensive metrics
4. **Existing Indexes** - Already optimized (entity, timestamp, article_id)
5. **Caching** - 2-minute TTL (already in place)

---

## Monitoring

### What to Watch
- Railway logs: `[Signals] Total request time`
- Should be < 2 seconds for cold cache
- Should be < 0.1 seconds for warm cache (cache hit)

### Red Flags
- ‚ùå Query count > 3
- ‚ùå Backend time > 5 seconds
- ‚ùå Payload size > 200 KB
- ‚ùå Errors: "Failed to fetch trending signals"

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Revert the commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or rollback in Railway:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Select the deployment
   - Click "Rollback" to previous version

3. **Check logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code changes complete
2. ‚è≥ Test locally
3. ‚è≥ Create PR and merge
4. ‚è≥ Deploy to Railway
5. ‚è≥ Monitor performance
6. ‚è≥ Verify user experience

## Questions?

- **Why reduce from 20 to 5 articles?** Users rarely expand to see all articles, and 5 is sufficient for context while reducing payload size.
- **Why 3 queries?** One for entities, one for narratives, one for articles. Can't reduce further without denormalizing data.
- **Why 2-minute cache?** Balance between fresh data and performance. Can increase to 5 minutes if needed.
- **What if cache is disabled?** Falls back to in-memory cache with same TTL.
