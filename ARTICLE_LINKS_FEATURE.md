# Article Links Feature - Implementation Summary

**Branch:** `feature/article-links`  
**Status:** âœ… Complete and Tested  
**Date:** 2025-10-07

## Overview

Added clickable article links to both Signals and Narratives pages, allowing users to view and access the actual articles that mention trending entities or support narrative themes.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend API Updates

#### **Signals API** (`src/crypto_news_aggregator/api/v1/endpoints/signals.py`)

**Added Function:**
```python
async def get_recent_articles_for_entity(entity: str, limit: int = 5)
```
- Queries `entity_mentions` collection to find articles mentioning the entity
- Fetches up to 5 most recent articles per signal
- Uses MongoDB ObjectId to correctly link mentions to articles
- Returns: `title`, `url`, `source`, `published_at`

**Updated Endpoint:**
- `/api/v1/signals/trending` now includes `recent_articles` array in each signal
- Articles are fetched in parallel for all signals

**Key Fix:**
- Corrected article lookup to use `_id` field instead of `source_id` (entity_mentions stores MongoDB ObjectIds, not source URLs)

#### **Narratives API** (`src/crypto_news_aggregator/api/v1/endpoints/narratives.py`)

**Added Function:**
```python
async def get_articles_for_narrative(article_ids: List[str], limit: int = 20)
```
- Fetches up to 20 articles per narrative from stored `article_ids`
- Converts string IDs to ObjectIds for database query
- Returns same fields as signals: `title`, `url`, `source`, `published_at`

**Updated Endpoint:**
- `/api/v1/narratives/active` now includes `articles` array in each narrative
- Uses existing `article_ids` field from narrative documents

---

### 2. Frontend Type Definitions

#### **TypeScript Types** (`context-owl-ui/src/types/index.ts`)

**New Interface:**
```typescript
export interface ArticleLink {
  title: string;
  url: string;
  source: string;
  published_at: string;
}
```

**Updated Interfaces:**
- `Signal` interface: Added `recent_articles: ArticleLink[]`
- `Narrative` interface: Added `articles: ArticleLink[]`

---

### 3. Frontend UI Components

#### **Signals Page** (`context-owl-ui/src/pages/Signals.tsx`)

**Features Added:**
- Collapsible "â–¶ Recent mentions (X)" section below each signal card
- Shows count of available articles
- Expands on click to reveal article list
- Each article displays:
  - Title as clickable link (opens in new tab)
  - Source name (capitalized)
  - Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Collapsed by default
- State managed with `useState<Set<number>>` for multiple expandable sections

**UI Styling:**
- Articles in light gray background (`bg-gray-50`)
- Blue clickable links with hover effects
- Small text size for compact display
- Border separator from other sections

#### **Narratives Page** (`context-owl-ui/src/pages/Narratives.tsx`)

**Features Added:**
- Collapsible "â–¶ ðŸ“° View X articles" section below each narrative card
- Same interaction pattern as Signals page
- Displays up to 20 articles per narrative
- Identical styling and layout to Signals for consistency

**Query Optimization:**
- Added `staleTime: 0` to force fresh data fetches
- Prevents stale cached data from showing

---

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- **entity_mentions collection**: Stores `article_id` as MongoDB ObjectId
- **articles collection**: Primary key is `_id` (ObjectId), `source_id` is the URL
- **narratives collection**: Stores `article_ids` as array of ObjectId strings

### API Response Format

**Signals Response:**
```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "entity": "JPMorgan",
      "recent_articles": [
        {
          "title": "Bitcoin Miners Posted Record Profits...",
          "url": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/...",
          "source": "coindesk",
          "published_at": "2025-10-07T14:29:06"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Narratives Response:**
```json
{
  "theme": "payments",
  "title": "Crypto Innovations Disrupt...",
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "BNY Mellon Launches...",
      "url": "https://...",
      "source": "cointelegraph",
      "published_at": "2025-10-07T13:21:10"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### Backend Tests
âœ… Article fetch functions execute without errors  
âœ… API endpoints return `recent_articles` and `articles` fields  
âœ… ObjectId conversion works correctly  
âœ… Empty arrays returned when no articles found  

### Frontend Tests
âœ… TypeScript compilation succeeds  
âœ… Build completes without errors  
âœ… UI renders article sections correctly  
âœ… Expand/collapse functionality works  
âœ… Links open in new tabs  
âœ… Relative time formatting displays correctly  

### Manual Testing
âœ… Verified with curl that API returns article data  
âœ… Confirmed browser receives and displays articles  
âœ… Tested with multiple signals and narratives  
âœ… Verified all links are clickable and functional

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Frontend must point to `http://localhost:8000` via `.env.local`
- **Production**: Frontend points to Railway production URL via `.env`

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Backend
poetry run uvicorn src.crypto_news_aggregator.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend (create .env.local first)
cd context-owl-ui
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env.local
echo "VITE_API_KEY=<your-key>" >> .env.local
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment
- Merge `feature/article-links` to `main` via PR
- Railway will auto-deploy backend changes
- Frontend will automatically use production API URL

---

## User Experience

### Before
- Users saw trending signals but couldn't access source articles
- Narratives showed article counts but no way to read them
- No direct path from insight to source material

### After
- **Signals Page**: Click "Recent mentions (X)" to see up to 5 recent articles per signal
- **Narratives Page**: Click "ðŸ“° View X articles" to see up to 20 articles per narrative
- All article links open in new tabs for easy reference
- Clean, collapsible UI keeps pages uncluttered by default

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- [ ] Add article preview/snippet on hover
- [ ] Filter articles by source or date
- [ ] Sort articles by relevance or recency
- [ ] Add "View all articles" link to dedicated page
- [ ] Cache article data to reduce API calls
- [ ] Add loading states for article fetching
- [ ] Implement pagination for narratives with many articles

---

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Zero TypeScript errors
- âœ… Zero runtime errors
- âœ… All API endpoints return expected data structure
