# CORS Fix Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Issue:** Browser preview proxy blocked by CORS policy  
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

## Problem

The browser was unable to fetch narratives data due to CORS error:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/narratives/active' 
from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:62140' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause

The CORS middleware regex pattern only allowed `localhost` origins but not `127.0.0.1`:

```python
# Before (line 153):
allow_origin_regex=r"^(http://localhost:\d+|https://.*\.vercel\.app)$"
```

The browser preview proxy uses `http://127.0.0.1:62140` which didn't match the pattern.

## Solution

Updated the CORS regex to include both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`:

```python
# After (line 153):
allow_origin_regex=r"^(http://(localhost|127\.0\.0\.1):\d+|https://.*\.vercel\.app)$"
```

### File Changed
- `/Users/mc/dev-projects/crypto-news-aggregator/src/crypto_news_aggregator/main.py` (line 153)

## Verification

### CORS Preflight Test
```bash
curl -I -X OPTIONS "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/narratives/active" \
  -H "Origin: http://127.0.0.1:62140" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
```

**Result:**
```
access-control-allow-origin: http://127.0.0.1:62140
access-control-allow-credentials: true
access-control-allow-methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT
access-control-max-age: 600
```

âœ… CORS headers now correctly allow the browser preview proxy origin.

### API Test
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/narratives/active?limit=3" \
  -H "Origin: http://127.0.0.1:62140"
```

**Result:**
```
âœ… API working - 3 narratives returned
```

## Impact

- âœ… Browser preview proxy can now access the API
- âœ… Frontend can fetch narratives data
- âœ… Pulse view timeline should now render properly
- âœ… No impact on existing localhost:5173 or Vercel deployments

## Next Steps

1. âœ… CORS fix applied and verified
2. ðŸ”„ Refresh browser at `http://127.0.0.1:62140` to see narratives
3. ðŸŽ¯ Navigate to Narratives page â†’ Pulse view
4. ðŸŽ¯ Verify timeline bars show varied widths and opacity

**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED  
**Server Status:** âœ… Running with updated CORS config  
**Frontend Status:** âœ… Ready to display narratives
