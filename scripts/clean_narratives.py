"""
Clean narratives from MongoDB.

This script deletes all narratives from the MongoDB narratives collection,
allowing the system to regenerate them with corrected code.

PROBLEM:
The narrative discovery system created 30+ narratives that are still in the 
MongoDB database. Rolling back the code didn't delete them.

SOLUTION:
This script cleans the narratives collection and lets the system regenerate 
with the corrected code.

Usage:
    # Dry run (show what would be deleted)
    poetry run python scripts/clean_narratives.py --dry-run
    
    # Delete all narratives
    poetry run python scripts/clean_narratives.py --yes
    
    # Delete narratives older than N days
    poetry run python scripts/clean_narratives.py --days 7 --yes
