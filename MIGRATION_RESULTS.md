## Impact

### Before Migration
- Entities fragmented across variants (Bitcoin, BTC, $BTC, btc)
- Duplicate entity mentions per article
- Signals calculated separately for each variant
- Inconsistent entity names in UI

### After Migration
- ✅ All variants unified under canonical names
- ✅ Duplicate mentions merged (80 duplicates removed)
- ✅ Signals combine all variant mentions
- ✅ Consistent entity names across system
- ✅ 22.9% of mentions normalized to canonical form

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Migration completed
2. ✅ Signals recalculated
3. ⏳ Monitor UI for consistent entity display
4. ⏳ Monitor new articles for automatic normalization
5. ⏳ Verify entity alerts use canonical names

## Monitoring

### What to Watch
- New entity mentions should use canonical names automatically
- Entity signals should continue grouping by canonical names
- UI should display consistent entity names (e.g., "Bitcoin" not "BTC")
- No duplicate entity entries in trending lists

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Database changes are one-way (normalized data remains)
3. Re-run migration with updated mappings if needed

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Migration completed without errors
- [x] All Bitcoin variants merged to "Bitcoin"
- [x] Signals recalculated successfully
- [x] No data loss (all mentions preserved)
- [x] Duplicate mentions properly merged
- [x] Production deployment successful
