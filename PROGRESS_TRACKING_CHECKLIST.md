### Safety Checks

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Try/except around article processing
- ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- ✅ Failed articles don't stop batch processing
- ✅ All exceptions caught and logged

#### Division Safety
- ✅ Zero-check for success rate calculation (Line 188)
- ✅ Zero-check for time remaining calculation (Line 179)
- ✅ Batch size always > 0 (validated earlier)

#### Edge Cases
- ✅ Handles last batch (may be smaller than batch_size)
- ✅ Handles zero articles (early return)
- ✅ Handles all failures in a batch
- ✅ Handles all successes in a batch

### Performance

#### No Performance Impact
- ✅ Calculations are O(1) per batch
- ✅ No additional API calls
- ✅ No additional database queries
- ✅ Minimal memory overhead
- ✅ No blocking operations

#### Rate Limiting Preserved
- ✅ Same batch size (15 articles)
- ✅ Same batch delay (30s)
- ✅ Same article delay (1.0s)
- ✅ Same throughput (~20 articles/min)
- ✅ Same warnings (>22 articles/min)

### Backward Compatibility

#### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ Same function signature
- ✅ Same return value (count of successful updates)
- ✅ Same command-line arguments
- ✅ Same MongoDB queries
- ✅ Same rate limiting behavior

#### Enhanced Behavior
- ✅ More detailed logging
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ More statistics
- ✅ Better user experience

### During First Production Run
- [ ] Monitor initial output for correct formatting
- [ ] Verify progress percentages increase correctly
- [ ] Check time estimates for accuracy
