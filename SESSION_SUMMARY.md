# Duplicate Narratives Resolution - Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17 to 2025-10-18  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Completed

---

## 🎯 Problem

**229 narratives had NULL fingerprints** - catastrophic matching failure

- All had `nucleus_entity = None`
- Should have been merged into ~100 consolidated narratives
- Signal scores fragmented across duplicates
- Poor user experience with duplicate stories

---

## 🔧 Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Backfill NULL Fingerprints

**Script:** `scripts/backfill_null_fingerprints.py`

**What it does:**
1. Query 229 narratives with NULL fingerprints
2. Fetch articles for each narrative
3. Extract entity data from articles (nucleus, actors, actions)
4. Generate proper fingerprints using `compute_narrative_fingerprint()`
5. Update narratives with regenerated fingerprints

**Result:** ✅ 228/229 successfully backfilled (99.6% success rate)

### Step 2: Merge Duplicate Narratives

**Script:** `scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py`

**What it does:**
1. Group narratives by `nucleus_entity`
2. Calculate pairwise similarity (using production code)
3. Merge if similarity >= threshold (0.5 recent, 0.6 older)
4. Consolidate articles, salience, lifecycle states
5. Delete duplicates

**Result:** ✅ 112 duplicates merged in 3 rounds
