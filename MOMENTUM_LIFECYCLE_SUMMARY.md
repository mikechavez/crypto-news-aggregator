# Momentum-Lifecycle Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completed

Successfully implemented momentum-aware lifecycle calculation for narratives to fix the issue where all narratives were showing "Emerging" due to overly high thresholds.

## 📋 Changes Summary

### Commits
1. **`feat: add momentum-aware lifecycle calculation`** (16546c8)
   - Added `calculate_momentum()` function
   - Updated `determine_lifecycle_stage()` with momentum awareness
   - Modified `detect_narratives()` to calculate and use momentum
   - Updated `upsert_narrative()` to store momentum field
   - Updated worker.py to pass momentum field

2. **`fix: improve momentum calculation span handling and add tests`** (88c4b88)
   - Fixed span calculation to use `max(1.0, span)` instead of `or 1`
   - Added comprehensive test suite
   - Created implementation documentation

### Files Modified
- `src/crypto_news_aggregator/services/narrative_service.py` (100+ lines changed)
- `src/crypto_news_aggregator/db/operations/narratives.py` (6 lines changed)
- `src/crypto_news_aggregator/worker.py` (1 line changed)

### Files Created
- `MOMENTUM_LIFECYCLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed implementation guide
- `scripts/test_momentum_calculation.py` - Test suite for momentum logic

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Momentum Calculation
Analyzes article publication velocity over time:
- **Growing** (≥1.3x velocity increase): Articles accelerating
- **Declining** (≤0.7x velocity decrease): Articles decelerating  
- **Stable**: Consistent publication rate
- **Unknown**: Insufficient data (<3 articles)

### 2. Adjusted Lifecycle Thresholds
**Old thresholds** (too high):
- Hot: velocity > 2.0
- Mature: velocity > 3.0
- Result: Everything stuck at "emerging"

**New thresholds** (realistic):
- Mature: velocity ≥ 5.0
- Hot: velocity ≥ 1.5 OR article_count ≥ 5
- Emerging: Everything else

### 3. Momentum-Enhanced Lifecycle States
New refined states based on momentum:
- **Rising**: Emerging narrative gaining traction
- **Heating**: Hot narrative accelerating
- **Cooling**: Mature narrative losing steam

Original states preserved:
- **Emerging**: New or small narratives
- **Hot**: Active narratives with momentum
- **Mature**: Established narratives with high activity

## 📊 Test Results

All tests passing ✅:
- Momentum calculation (growing, declining, stable, unknown)
- Lifecycle stage determination (all 6 states)
- Threshold comparison (old vs new)

### Example Test Output
```
Scenario             Old Result      New Result     
--------------------------------------------------
5a, 1.5v             emerging        hot            
8a, 2.0v, stab       emerging        hot            
12a, 3.5v, stab      mature          hot            
3a, 0.5v, grow       emerging        rising         
```

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Momentum Algorithm
1. Sort article dates chronologically
2. Split into older and recent halves
3. Calculate velocity (articles/hour) for each half
4. Compare velocities to determine trend
5. Apply thresholds: ≥1.3x = growing, ≤0.7x = declining

### Lifecycle Integration
```python
# Base lifecycle from thresholds
if velocity >= 5: lifecycle = "mature"
elif velocity >= 1.5 or count >= 5: lifecycle = "hot"
else: lifecycle = "emerging"

# Refine with momentum
if lifecycle == "mature" and momentum == "declining": return "cooling"
if lifecycle == "hot" and momentum == "growing": return "heating"
if lifecycle == "emerging" and momentum == "growing": return "rising"
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

New field added to `narratives` collection:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  "momentum": "growing" | "declining" | "stable" | "unknown",
  "lifecycle": "emerging" | "rising" | "hot" | "heating" | "mature" | "cooling"
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** - Merge feature branch
2. **Monitor results** - Watch narrative lifecycle distribution
3. **Tune thresholds** - Adjust based on real-world data if needed
4. **UI updates** - Display momentum indicators in frontend
5. **API enhancement** - Add momentum to API responses

## 📝 Usage

### Run Tests
```bash
poetry run python scripts/test_momentum_calculation.py
```

### Verify Implementation
The test script validates:
- Momentum calculation accuracy
- Lifecycle stage transitions
- Threshold improvements

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **More accurate lifecycle stages** - Narratives can now progress beyond "emerging"
2. **Momentum awareness** - Captures narrative trajectory (accelerating/decelerating)
3. **Richer insights** - New states like "heating", "cooling", "rising" provide nuance
4. **Backward compatible** - Default momentum value ensures existing code works
5. **Well-tested** - Comprehensive test suite validates all scenarios
