## Testing Plan

After merging and Railway deployment:

1. **Functional Testing**
   - [ ] Open production URL
   - [ ] Verify Signals page loads with data
   - [ ] Verify Narratives page loads with data
   - [ ] Check browser console for errors
   - [ ] Verify API calls succeed (Network tab)

2. **Cross-Browser Testing**

   - [ ] Monitor Vercel analytics

## Post-Merge Actions

1. **Railway will auto-deploy** the backend CORS changes
2. **Monitor Railway logs** for successful deployment
3. **Test production URL** using checklist above
4. **Update project README** with production URL

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Vercel Rollback
```bash
