## 🧪 Test Locally (Before Pushing)

### 1. Start Local Server
```bash
poetry run python -m uvicorn src.crypto_news_aggregator.main:app --reload
```

### 2. Run Performance Test Script
```bash
# Basic test
python scripts/test_signals_performance.py

# Test different timeframes
python scripts/test_signals_performance.py --timeframe 24h
python scripts/test_signals_performance.py --timeframe 7d
python scripts/test_signals_performance.py --timeframe 30d

# Run multiple tests to check consistency
python scripts/test_signals_performance.py --repeat 3
```

### 3. Expected Results
```
📊 Performance Results:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🌐 Network Metrics:
  Total Request Time:     1.234s
  HTTP Status Code:       200
  Payload Size:           67.42 KB

⚡ Backend Performance (from response):
  Backend Time:           0.847s
  Database Queries:       3
  Backend Payload Size:   67.42 KB

✅ Performance Assessment:
  Backend Speed:          ✅ Excellent (0.847s)
  Query Optimization:     ✅ Excellent (3 queries)
  Total Response Time:    ✅ Excellent (1.234s)
  Payload Size:           ✅ Excellent (67.42 KB)
```

### 4. Manual API Test
```bash
# Test the endpoint directly
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/signals/trending?limit=50&timeframe=7d" | jq '.performance'

# Should return:
# {
#   "total_time_seconds": 0.847,
#   "query_count": 3,
#   "payload_size_kb": 67.42
# }
```

## 🌐 Test Frontend

### 1. Start Frontend Dev Server
```bash
cd context-owl-ui
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser
- Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/signals
- Open Chrome DevTools → Console tab
- Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab

### 3. Check Console Output
```
[Signals] API Request (7d): 1234ms
[Signals] Response: {
  signalCount: 50,
  payloadSize: "67.42 KB",
  timeframe: "7d"
}
```

### 4. Check Network Tab
- Look for: `/api/v1/signals/trending?limit=50&timeframe=7d`
- Request duration should be < 2 seconds
- Response size should be < 100 KB

---

## 🚀 Push and Deploy

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin fix/signals-performance-n-plus-1
```

### 2. Create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub
- Create PR from `fix/signals-performance-n-plus-1` to `main`
- Title: "Fix: Optimize Signals endpoint (N+1 query problem)"
- Description: See commit message

### 3. Merge PR
- Review changes
- Merge to main
- Railway will auto-deploy

---

## 📊 Monitor Production (Railway)

### 1. Check Railway Logs
```bash
railway logs --tail 100
```

### 2. Look for Performance Metrics
```
[Signals] Fetched 50 trending entities in 0.234s
[Signals] Batch fetched 15 narratives in 0.087s
[Signals] Batch fetched 142 articles for 50 entities in 0.456s
[Signals] Total request time: 0.847s, Queries: 3, Payload: 67.42KB
```

### 3. Test Production API
```bash
# Replace with your Railway URL
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/signals/trending?limit=50&timeframe=7d" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" | jq '.performance'
```

### 4. Test Production UI
- Navigate to: https://your-app.vercel.app/signals
- Check browser console for timing
- Verify load time < 2 seconds

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Query count is still high"
**Cause:** Batch function not being used  
**Fix:** Check that `get_recent_articles_batch()` is called, not `get_recent_articles_for_entity()`

### Issue: "Backend time still slow"
**Possible causes:**
1. Database connection slow (check Railway logs)
2. Large number of entities (check signal count)
3. Missing indexes (run index creation script)

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs for slow queries
railway logs | grep "slow query"

# Check database indexes
python scripts/check_indexes.py
```

### Issue: "Payload size still large"
**Cause:** Too many articles per signal  
**Fix:** Verify `limit_per_entity=5` in `get_recent_articles_batch()` call

### Issue: "Frontend still slow"
**Possible causes:**
1. Network latency (check Network tab)
2. Backend still slow (check performance metrics in response)
3. Cache not working (check Railway logs for cache hits)

**Debug:**
- Check browser Network tab for request duration
- Check response `performance` object
- Clear cache and test again

## 📈 Success Criteria

### Backend Performance
- ✅ Query count: 3 (not 100+)
- ✅ Backend time: < 2 seconds (cold cache)
- ✅ Backend time: < 0.1 seconds (warm cache)
- ✅ Payload size: < 100 KB

### Frontend Performance
- ✅ Total load time: < 2 seconds
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Smooth tab switching

### User Experience
- ✅ Signals tab loads quickly
- ✅ No visible lag
