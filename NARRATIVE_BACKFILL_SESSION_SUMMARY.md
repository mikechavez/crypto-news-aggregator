# Narrative Backfill Session Summary

**Date**: October 11, 2025 (11:27 PM - 11:38 PM UTC-06:00)  
**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKED - API Credits Exhausted**

---

## Executive Summary

Attempted to run full production backfill to extract narrative data for all articles in the database. The backfill script is working correctly but was unable to process any articles due to exhausted Anthropic API credits.

### Current State
- **Total articles**: 1,329
- **With narrative data**: 0 (0%)
- **Need processing**: 1,329 (100%)
- **Estimated cost**: ~$12.40 (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.0)
- **Estimated time**: ~33 minutes

---

## What Happened

### 1. First Attempt (11:27 PM)
```bash
poetry run python scripts/backfill_narratives.py --hours 48 --limit 300 --batch-size 20 --batch-delay 30
```
**Result**: Only found 2 articles in last 48 hours, processed successfully.

### 2. Investigation (11:28 PM)
- Discovered database has 1,329 total articles
- All articles are missing narrative data
- Most articles are older than 48 hours

### 3. Corrected Attempt (11:34 PM)
```bash
poetry run python scripts/backfill_narratives.py --hours 720 --limit 1500 --batch-size 20 --batch-delay 30
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Stopped immediately - Anthropic API credits exhausted

## What Is Narrative Data?

The system extracts rich contextual information from each article:

- **Actors**: Entities involved (SEC, Binance, Bitcoin, etc.)
- **Actor Salience**: Importance scores (1-5) for each actor
- **Nucleus Entity**: Primary entity the article is about
- **Actions**: Key events that occurred
- **Tensions**: Forces at play (regulation vs innovation, etc.)
- **Implications**: Why it matters
- **Narrative Summary**: 2-3 sentence natural description

This enables **salience-based clustering** - grouping articles by shared actors and tensions for more specific narratives than theme-based grouping.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Add Credits & Resume (Recommended)
```bash
poetry run python scripts/backfill_narratives.py --hours 720 --limit 1500 --batch-size 20 --batch-delay 30
```
- Script will auto-resume from where it left off
- Cost: ~$12.40 for all 1,329 articles
- Time: ~33 minutes

### Option 2: Test with Small Batch
```bash
poetry run python scripts/backfill_narratives.py --hours 720 --limit 50 --batch-size 10 --batch-delay 30
```
- Process only 50 articles
- Cost: ~$0.50
- Time: ~2 minutes

### Option 3: Switch LLM Provider
- Modify `discover_narrative_from_article()` in `narrative_themes.py`
- Use OpenAI, Google, or other provider with available credits

## System Status

### ‚úÖ Ready Components
1. **Narrative Discovery System** - Implemented and tested
2. **Backfill Script** - Rate limiting, batch processing, error handling
3. **Clustering Algorithm** - Salience-based clustering working (67% success rate on test batch)
4. **Database Schema** - All fields added to article model

### üìã Previous Work Completed
- Fixed JSON parsing errors (LLM response handling)
- Increased token limits (1024 ‚Üí 2048) to prevent truncation
- Added rate limiting for API constraints
- Implemented defensive coding for missing data
- Created production-ready backfill script

See `SALIENCE_CLUSTERING_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` for full technical details.

## Technical Details

### Backfill Script Features
- **Idempotent**: Only processes articles without narrative data
- **Resumable**: Can be stopped and restarted safely
- **Rate Limited**: Respects Anthropic limits (50 req/min, 30k tokens/min)
- **Batch Processing**: 20 articles per batch, 30s delays
- **Error Handling**: Continues on failures, tracks success/failure counts

### Cost Breakdown
- Input: ~800 tokens/article √ó $3/M tokens = ~$2.40
- Output: ~500 tokens/article √ó $15/M tokens = ~$10.00
- **Total**: ~$12.40 for 1,329 articles

### Processing Strategy
- 66 batches of 20 articles each
- 30 seconds between batches
- ~40 articles/minute throughput
- Stays under API rate limits
