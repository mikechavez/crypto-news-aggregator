# Crypto News Aggregator

A real-time cryptocurrency news aggregator that collects articles from various sources, performs sentiment analysis, and provides insights into market trends.

## Features

- **News Collection**: Fetches cryptocurrency news from multiple sources using NewsAPI
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes article sentiment using TextBlob's NLP capabilities
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks sentiment trends over time
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI-based endpoints for accessing news and analysis
- **Background Processing**: Celery workers for async task processing
- **Containerized**: Docker Compose setup for easy deployment

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache & Message Broker**: Redis
- **Task Queue**: Celery
- **NLP**: TextBlob
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Poetry (for local development)
- NewsAPI key

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/crypto_news
   CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/0
   ```

### Running with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- FastAPI app on http://localhost:8000
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis server
- Celery worker
- Celery beat (for scheduled tasks)

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn crypto_news_aggregator.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Start Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A crypto_news_aggregator.tasks worker --loglevel=info
   ```

## Test Types in This Project

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution
- Example: `test_sentiment_analyzer.py`

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Use real database and services
- Slower but more realistic
- Example: `test_sentiment_pipeline.py`
