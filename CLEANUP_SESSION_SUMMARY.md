**Status:** âœ… Complete

## What We Did

### 1. Merged Duplicate Narratives (8 pairs eliminated)
**Command:** `poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --yes`

**Results:**
- Merged 8 duplicate narrative pairs using fingerprint similarity (0.589-0.637)
- Consolidated 117 articles into primary narratives
- Reduced narrative count: 118 â†’ 110 (-6.8%)

**Key Merges:**
- "Ripple's Strategic $1B Crypto Play" (13 articles)
- "Crypto Volatility and Macroeconomic Tensions" (64 articles)
- "Ethereum's Rise and Implications" (9 articles)
- 5 other duplicate pairs

### 2. Implemented Benzinga Content Removal System
**Problem:** Benzinga articles contain advertising content, not news

**Code Changes:**
- **RSS Service** (`rss_service.py`): Commented out Benzinga feed URL
- **RSS Fetcher** (`rss_fetcher.py`): Added `BLACKLIST_SOURCES = ['benzinga']` with runtime filtering
- **Article Model** (`article.py`): Removed "benzinga" from valid sources list
- **Script Created:** `scripts/remove_benzinga_completely.py` with dry-run support

**Prevention Layers:** 4-layer system (RSS config, runtime filter, model validation, entity blacklist)

**Status:** âœ… 31 Benzinga articles deleted successfully

### 3. Verified Empty Title Cleanup
**Command:** `poetry run python scripts/delete_empty_title_narratives.py`

**Results:** 0 empty titles found (already cleaned up from previous work)

### 4. Quality Audit Verification
**Command:** `poetry run python scripts/audit_narrative_quality.py`

**Results:**
- Total narratives: 110 (target: ~109) âœ…
- "Unknown" entities: 0 (was 125) âœ…
- Empty titles: 0 (was 8) âœ…
- Duplicates: 0 (was 24) âœ…
