## 🐛 Known Issues

### False Positives in Automated Tests
The verification script reported 4 failed tests for dark colors, but these are **false positives**:

```javascript
❌ Dark color: dark-bg: Not found in config
❌ Dark color: dark-card: Not found in config
❌ Dark color: dark-border: Not found in config
❌ Dark color: dark-hover: Not found in config
```

**Actual Status:** ✅ All colors ARE defined in `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.extend.colors.dark`

The script was looking for hyphenated names (`dark-bg`) but Tailwind uses nested objects (`dark.bg`).

### API URL Configuration
```
⚠️  API base URL: Not set to localhost:8000
```

**Actual Status:** ✅ API URL is set via environment variable `VITE_API_URL`
- Currently points to: `https://context-owl-production.up.railway.app`
- For local testing, update `.env` to: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
