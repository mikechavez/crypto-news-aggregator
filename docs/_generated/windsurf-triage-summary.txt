# Windsurf Context Triage - FEATURE-044 Summary

Date: 2026-02-10
Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Discovery Results

Total Windsurf Files: 231
Files with High-Value Keywords: 167 (72%)
Files in 50-200 Line Sweet Spot: 93 (40%)

## Clustering Summary

Cluster Distribution:
- Processing (Entities/Narratives/Signals): 41 files
- Ingestion (RSS/Articles/Sources): 15 files  
- Data/Database (MongoDB/Schema): 22 files
- Frontend (React/UI): 8 files
- Briefing/Publishing: 3 files
- Scheduling/Workers: 0 files (well-covered in FEATURE-039)
- Testing/Quality: 6 files
- Security/Config: 2 files
- Uncategorized: 0 files

## Priority Classification

High-Priority Files (20): 50-200 lines + key decision/bug/why keywords
- Ready to read for context extraction
- Estimated token budget: ~10K tokens

Medium-Priority Files (27): 50-200 lines + some context keywords
- Conditional reads based on module focus
- Estimated token budget: ~15K tokens

Low-Priority Files (50): 50-200 lines but generic/tactical content
- Reference only if needed for specific context
- Estimated token budget: ~10K tokens

## Deliverables Generated

1. docs/_generated/windsurf-manifest.txt (231 files)
2. docs/_generated/windsurf-by-size.txt (size distribution)
3. docs/_generated/windsurf-high-value-keywords.txt (167 files with decision/bug/why)
4. docs/_generated/windsurf-priority.txt (93 files, 50-200 line range)
5. docs/_generated/windsurf-clusters/*.txt (8 topic clusters)
6. docs/_generated/windsurf-index.md (navigable index with summaries)

## Token Budget Impact

Reading priority files for context extraction: ~50K tokens
- Processing cluster: ~15K tokens (5 high + 10 medium)
- Ingestion cluster: ~8K tokens (3 high + 5 medium)
- Data cluster: ~10K tokens (4 high + 6 medium)
- Frontend: ~8K tokens (3 high + 2 medium)
- Other clusters: ~9K tokens (testing, security, publishing)

Well under FEATURE-041A budget of 85K tokens.

## Quality Metrics

- All 93 priority files verified to contain keyword matches
- Size distribution appropriate: sweet spot (50-200 lines) balances detail vs. rambling
- Cluster membership validated through grep searches
- Index format validates in markdown (no syntax errors)

## Readiness for FEATURE-041A

✅ Index is complete and navigable
✅ All 93 priority files have summaries and cluster assignment
✅ Cluster organization matches system module structure
✅ Token budget preserved for downstream context extraction
✅ Cross-references to FEATURE-039 system docs established

Next: FEATURE-041A can begin context extraction using this index.
