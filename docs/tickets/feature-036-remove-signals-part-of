# Remove "Part of:" Section from Signals Page

## Problem/Opportunity
The Signals page currently shows a "Part of:" section that lists which narratives each signal belongs to. However:
- These narrative links don't go anywhere useful (they navigate to the generic `/narratives` page)
- There's no way to highlight or find the specific narratives on that page
- This creates user confusion and frustration
- The feature provides negative value in its current state

**Until we implement narrative highlighting or detail pages that can be linked from signals, it's better to remove this section entirely than show broken/misleading functionality.**

## Proposed Solution
Remove the "Part of:" section from signal cards on the Signals page.

**What stays:**
- ✅ "Emerging" badge for signals not yet part of narratives
- ✅ Entity type, sources, last updated, velocity indicator
- ✅ Recent articles section (useful and functional)

**What gets removed:**
- ❌ "Part of:" label and narrative theme badges

## User Story
As a user viewing signals, I want to see only functional, actionable information so that I'm not confused or frustrated by features that don't work as expected.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Part of:" section completely removed from signal cards
- [ ] "Emerging" badge still displays for signals not in narratives
- [ ] Layout remains clean after removal (no awkward spacing)
- [ ] Recent articles section still works correctly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design maintained

## Dependencies
- None

## Open Questions
- [x] Should we keep the "Emerging" badge? (Yes - provides useful info)
- [x] Should we add this back later when we have proper narrative links? (Yes, Phase 2)

## Implementation Notes

### Current Code (Signals.tsx)

**File:** `context-owl-ui/src/pages/Signals.tsx`  
**Lines to Remove:** 197-219

**Current implementation:**
```typescript
{/* Narrative context section */}
<div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-gray-200 dark:border-dark-border">
  {signal.is_emerging ? (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <span className="text-xs font-medium text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-300 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900/30 px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
        🆕 Emerging
      </span>
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Not yet part of any narrative</span>
    </div>
  ) : signal.narratives && signal.narratives.length > 0 ? (
    <div>
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 block mb-1">Part of:</span>
      <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-1">
        {signal.narratives.map((narrative) => (
          <button
            key={narrative.id}
            onClick={() => navigate('/narratives')}
            className={`text-xs font-medium px-2 py-1 rounded-full transition-colors ${getThemeColor(narrative.theme)}`}
            title={narrative.title}
          >
            {formatTheme(narrative.theme)}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  ) : null}
</div>
```

---

### Updated Implementation

**Replace entire section (lines 197-219) with:**

```typescript
{/* Narrative context section - only show Emerging badge */}
{signal.is_emerging && (
  <div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-gray-200 dark:border-dark-border">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <span className="text-xs font-medium text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-300 bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900/30 px-2 py-1 rounded-full">
        🆕 Emerging
      </span>
      <span className="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Not yet part of any narrative</span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**What changed:**
1. Removed the entire `signal.narratives` branch
2. Kept only the `is_emerging` badge
3. Simplified conditional rendering
4. Maintained border/spacing for consistent layout

---

### Visual Impact

**Before:**
```
Signal Card
├─ Entity name & velocity badge
├─ Type: Cryptocurrency
├─ Sources: 3 sources
├─ Last Updated: 2 hours ago
├─ ─────────────────────────  (border)
├─ Part of:                    ❌ REMOVE THIS
│  ├─ [Market Regulation]      ❌ REMOVE THIS
│  └─ [DeFi Growth]            ❌ REMOVE THIS
└─ ─────────────────────────  (border)
   └─ ▶ Recent mentions (3)
```

**After:**
```
Signal Card
├─ Entity name & velocity badge
├─ Type: Cryptocurrency
├─ Sources: 3 sources
├─ Last Updated: 2 hours ago
├─ ─────────────────────────  (border)
├─ 🆕 Emerging                 ✅ KEEP (if emerging)
│  └─ Not yet part of any narrative
└─ ─────────────────────────  (border)
   └─ ▶ Recent mentions (3)
```

### Testing Checklist

#### Visual Testing
- [ ] Signal cards render correctly
- [ ] Emerging badge still shows for new signals
- [ ] Non-emerging signals show no narrative section
- [ ] Layout spacing looks natural (no awkward gaps)
- [ ] Border styling consistent

#### Functional Testing
- [ ] No console errors when loading signals page
- [ ] Recent articles section still expands/collapses
- [ ] Velocity badges still display
- [ ] Entity type badges still show
- [ ] Dark mode styling correct

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Signal with `is_emerging: true` shows badge
- [ ] Signal with `is_emerging: false` shows nothing
- [ ] Signal with `is_emerging: null/undefined` shows nothing
- [ ] Signal with empty narratives array shows nothing

---

### File Checklist

**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `context-owl-ui/src/pages/Signals.tsx` (lines 197-219)

**Total:** 1 file, ~20 lines removed, ~8 lines added

---

### Rollback Plan
If users complain about missing narrative context, we can easily re-add it once FEATURE-034 (narrative detail pages) is complete. At that point, the buttons would link to actual narrative detail pages instead of the generic list.

**Future enhancement (Phase 2):**
```typescript
// When narrative detail pages exist
<button
  onClick={() => navigate(`/narratives/${narrative.id}`)}
  className="..."
>
  {formatTheme(narrative.theme)}
</button>
```

---

### Estimated Effort
- Code changes: 5 minutes
- Testing: 5 minutes
- **Total: 10 minutes**

---

### Success Metrics
- [ ] No user confusion about narrative links
- [ ] Signals page loads without errors
- [ ] Layout remains clean and professional
- [ ] "Emerging" badge provides clear value

---

## Related Work

**Phase 2 Enhancements (Future):**
1. After FEATURE-034 completes, re-add "Part of:" section with working links
2. Add narrative highlighting when navigating from signals
3. Consider showing top 2-3 narratives with "see all" option if >3
