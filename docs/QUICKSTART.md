| See current sprint status | `"What's on the sprint?"` |
| Start work on a ticket | `"Let's work on FEATURE-003"` |
| Mark ticket complete | `"This ticket is done"` |
| End session / wrap up | `"Wrap up"` or `"End of day"` |
| Start new sprint | `"Let's start a new sprint"` |
| Check vision/roadmap context | `"What does the vision say about...?"` |

## 🔄 Daily Workflow (Summary)

**Morning:**
1. `cat docs/current-sprint.md` - See what's planned
2. Tell Claude: `"Let's work on TICKET-XXX"`
3. Claude updates sprint doc, you create branch
4. Move ticket file: `backlog/` → `in-progress/`

**During Work:**
- Claude auto-updates `docs/current-sprint.md`
- Code + sprint doc committed together
- No "update sprint" in commit messages

**End of Day:**
1. Tell Claude: `"Wrap up"`
2. Claude generates daily wrap
3. Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "..."`
4. Update ticket files if needed

## 📋 Ticket Workflow (Summary)

### Creating Tickets
```bash
# Use template
cp docs/ticket-templates/ticket-template-feature.md \
   /claude-vault/.../backlog/feature-description.md

# Fill in:
id: FEATURE-XXX        # Next sequential number
priority: high/medium/low
complexity: high/medium/low
# + problem, solution, acceptance criteria
```

### Ticket States
```
backlog/ → in-progress/ → done/
```

### Finding Next Ticket ID
```bash
# Check highest number in backlog and done folders
ls /claude-vault/.../backlog/ | grep FEATURE
ls /claude-vault/.../done/ | grep FEATURE
# Use next sequential number
```

---

## 🏃 Sprint Workflow (Summary)

### During Sprint
- Work on tickets in priority order
- Update `docs/current-sprint.md` automatically (Claude does this)
- Can add/defer tickets mid-sprint

### End Sprint / Start New Sprint
```bash
./scripts/new-sprint.sh
# Follow prompts:
# 1. Confirms transition
# 2. Archives current sprint
# 3. Opens retro for you to fill
# 4. Creates new sprint
# 5. Commits changes
```

### After Sprint Transition
1. Edit `docs/current-sprint.md` - add goal and tickets
2. Update external `SPRINTS.md` with new sprint

## 🔧 Git Workflow

### Branch Names
```bash
feature/ticket-description
fix/bug-description
docs/doc-description
chore/task-description
```

### Commit Format
```bash
type(scope): short description

- Bullet details
- More details

Fixes: TICKET-XXX
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

### Commit + Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add briefing endpoint

- Create POST /api/v1/briefing
- Add morning/evening types"

git push origin feature/branch-name
```

## 📊 Complexity Estimates

- **Low:** < 2 hours, well-understood
- **Medium:** 2-4 hours, some unknowns
- **High:** > 4 hours, many unknowns, architectural

---

## 🎯 Priority Levels

1. **Critical bugs** - Blocking production
2. **High-value features** - Current phase alignment
3. **Technical debt** - If blocking future work
4. **Nice-to-haves** - Defer to later
