# Merge Duplicate Narratives - Quick Start

**Consolidate 229 duplicate narratives in 3 steps**

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Run `backfill_null_fingerprints.py` first to fix NULL fingerprints

## TL;DR

```bash
# 1. Preview merges (safe, no changes)
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --dry-run

# 2. Test on one nucleus entity
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --nucleus "Bitcoin" --verbose

# 3. Merge all duplicates
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py
```

## The Problem

After backfill, many narratives share the same `nucleus_entity`:
- 45 narratives about "Bitcoin"
- 32 narratives about "Ethereum"
- 18 narratives about "SEC"
- etc.

These should be merged into consolidated narratives.

## The Solution

This script merges narratives with similar fingerprints (similarity >= 0.6).

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Preview Merges (Safe)

```bash
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --dry-run --verbose
```

**What happens:**
- Shows what would be merged
- No database changes
- Takes ~30 seconds

**Expected output:**
```
üìä Found 229 narratives
üîç Checking nucleus 'Bitcoin' (45 narratives)
   Found 12 duplicate pairs
   [DRY RUN] Would merge 'Bitcoin Price...' (5 articles) 
   ‚Üí 'Bitcoin Market...' (23 articles) [similarity: 0.723]

MERGE SUMMARY
Duplicate pairs found:         48
Would merge: 48 duplicates
Reduction: 229 ‚Üí 181 narratives (21.0% reduction)
```

### Step 2: Test on One Nucleus (Recommended)

```bash
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --nucleus "Bitcoin" --verbose
```

**What happens:**
- Only merges Bitcoin narratives
- Shows detailed logs
- Updates database
- Takes ~5 seconds

**Expected output:**
```
üéØ Filtering to nucleus: 'Bitcoin'
üîç Checking nucleus 'Bitcoin' (45 narratives)
   ‚úÖ Merged 'Bitcoin Price...' (5 articles) ‚Üí 'Bitcoin Market...' (28 articles)
   ‚úÖ Merged 'Bitcoin Trading...' (8 articles) ‚Üí 'Bitcoin Market...' (36 articles)
   ...
Merges performed: 12
```

### Step 3: Merge All Duplicates (Production)

```bash
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py
```

**What happens:**
- Processes all nucleus entities
- Asks for confirmation (type 'y')
- Updates database
- Takes ~1 minute

**Expected output:**
```
‚ùì Proceed with merge? [y/N]: y
üöÄ Starting merge...
‚úÖ Merged 48 duplicate narratives
Reduction: 229 ‚Üí 181 narratives
```

## Verify Results

After merge, verify it worked:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/check_duplicate_narratives.py
```

**Expected:** Significantly fewer duplicates (e.g., 181 instead of 229)

## Adaptive Thresholds

The script uses smart thresholds:
- **Recent narratives (updated within 48h):** 0.5 threshold
- **Older narratives (>48h):** 0.6 threshold

This allows recent stories to merge more easily while keeping strict matching for older ones.

## Custom Threshold

Want stricter matching?

```bash
# Use 0.7 threshold for older narratives
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --threshold 0.7 --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No duplicates found"
‚úÖ Fingerprints are unique - no merges needed

### Too many merges
‚ö†Ô∏è Threshold too low. Try:
```bash
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --threshold 0.7 --dry-run
```

### Too few merges
‚ö†Ô∏è Threshold too high. Try:
```bash
poetry run python scripts/merge_duplicate_narratives.py --threshold 0.5 --dry-run
```

## What Gets Merged

For each merge:
- **Primary:** Narrative with most articles (kept)
- **Duplicate:** Other narrative (deleted)
- **Article IDs:** Combined and deduplicated
- **Entity Salience:** Averaged across both
- **Lifecycle State:** Recalculated from combined data
