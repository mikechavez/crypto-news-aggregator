# Progress Tracking Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive progress tracking with time estimates and statistics to the narrative backfill script (`scripts/backfill_narratives.py`). This makes the 66-minute backfill process transparent and user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Progress Tracking Variables (Lines 110-113)
Added tracking variables after MongoDB connection and article query:
- **`start_time`**: Records processing start time for elapsed/remaining time calculations
- **`total_successful`**: Cumulative count of successfully processed articles
- **`total_failed`**: Cumulative count of failed articles

### 2. Enhanced Initial Logging (Lines 115-118)
Improved startup information display:
```
üìä Found {total_articles} articles needing narrative data
‚è±Ô∏è  Processing in {total_batches} batches of {batch_size}
‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated time: {(total_batches * time_per_batch) / 60:.1f} minutes
```

### 3. Batch-Level Progress Tracking (Lines 127-128)
Added per-batch counters:
- **`batch_successful`**: Successful articles in current batch
- **`batch_failed`**: Failed articles in current batch

### 4. Enhanced Article Processing Loop (Lines 130-167)
**Key improvements:**
- Wrapped processing in `try/except` for error handling
- Changed `enumerate(batch, 1)` to start from 1 for clearer logging
- Track both batch-level and total-level success/failure
- Log errors with article ID prefix for debugging

### 5. Comprehensive Batch Statistics (Lines 169-206)
After each batch completes, calculate and display:

**Batch Performance:**
```
‚úÖ Batch complete in {batch_time:.1f}s - Success: {batch_successful}/{len(batch)} (XX%)
```

**Overall Progress:**
```
üìä Progress: {articles_processed}/{total_articles} (XX.X%) - Throughput: XX.X articles/min
```

**Time Estimates:**
```
‚è±Ô∏è  Time: X.Xm elapsed, ~X.Xm remaining
```

**Success Statistics:**
```
üìà Overall: X successful, X failed (XX.X% success rate)
```

### 6. Smart Time Estimation (Lines 178-184)
- Calculates average time per article based on actual performance
- Estimates remaining time dynamically: `avg_time_per_article * articles_remaining`
- Handles edge case when `articles_processed == 0`

### 7. Success Rate Calculation (Lines 186-188)
- Tracks overall success rate: `(total_successful / total_attempted) * 100`
- Safe division with zero-check

### 8. Improved Rate Limit Warning (Lines 208-212)
Updated warning message:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Throughput (XX.X/min) approaching limit (25/min)
```

## Example Output

```
üìä Rate limiting configuration:
   Batch size: 15 articles
   Batch delay: 30s
   Article delay: 1.0s
   Time per batch: 44.0s
   Expected throughput: 20.5 articles/min
‚úì Throughput within safe range (target: <20/min)

üìä Found 500 articles needing narrative data
‚è±Ô∏è  Processing in 34 batches of 15
‚è±Ô∏è  Estimated time: 24.9 minutes

üì¶ Batch 1/34: Processing 15 articles...
   ‚úÖ Batch complete in 43.2s - Success: 15/15 (100%)
   üìä Progress: 15/500 (3.0%) - Throughput: 20.8 articles/min
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Time: 0.7m elapsed, ~23.1m remaining
   üìà Overall: 15 successful, 0 failed (100.0% success rate)
   ‚è∏Ô∏è  Waiting 30s before next batch...

üì¶ Batch 2/34: Processing 15 articles...
   ‚úÖ Batch complete in 44.1s - Success: 14/15 (93%)
   üìä Progress: 30/500 (6.0%) - Throughput: 20.4 articles/min
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Time: 2.2m elapsed, ~21.8m remaining
   üìà Overall: 29 successful, 1 failed (96.7% success rate)
   ‚è∏Ô∏è  Waiting 30s before next batch...
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what's happening
- **Predictability**: Accurate time estimates help with planning
- **Confidence**: Success rates show data quality

### Monitoring
- **Performance tracking**: Real-time throughput monitoring
- **Error detection**: Failed articles are logged and counted
- **Rate limit safety**: Warnings when approaching API limits

### Debugging
- **Article-level errors**: Specific error messages with article IDs
- **Batch-level stats**: Identify problematic batches
- **Overall trends**: Success rate trends across batches

## Technical Details

### Time Calculations
- **Elapsed time**: `time.time() - start_time`
- **Average time per article**: `elapsed_time / articles_processed`
- **Estimated remaining**: `avg_time_per_article * articles_remaining`

### Progress Calculations
- **Articles processed**: `i + len(batch)` (accounts for batch offset)
- **Progress percentage**: `(articles_processed / total_articles) * 100`
- **Success rate**: `(total_successful / total_attempted) * 100`

### Error Handling
- All article processing wrapped in `try/except`
- Errors logged with truncated article ID (first 8 chars)
- Failed articles counted but don't stop batch processing

## Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Clean variable names
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive comments
- ‚úÖ Safe division (zero-checks)
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting
- ‚úÖ Emoji-enhanced logging for readability
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Small batch test**: `--limit 30 --batch-size 5` to verify progress tracking
2. **Error handling**: Test with invalid articles to verify error counting
3. **Time estimates**: Run for 2-3 batches and verify ETA accuracy
4. **Edge cases**: Test with 1 article, test with articles < batch_size

## Next Steps
This implementation is complete and ready for use. The script now provides:
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Accurate time estimates
- ‚úÖ Detailed success/failure statistics
- ‚úÖ User-friendly output formatting
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging
