# Week 2 Archive Tab & Resurrection Features - Verification Results

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… VERIFIED - Backend Working, Frontend Ready for Manual Testing

## Summary

Successfully verified the Week 2 Archive Tab and Resurrection features implementation. The backend is fully functional with 3 resurrected narratives created and the API returning correct data. Frontend is running and ready for manual UI verification.

---

## 1. Backend Verification âœ…

### Narrative Detection Worker

**Command:** `poetry run python scripts/trigger_narrative_detection.py --hours 24`

**Results:**
- âœ… Successfully processed 12 narratives
- âœ… Matched 11 existing narratives
- âœ… Created 1 new narrative
- âœ… Duration: 54-66 seconds
- âœ… Lifecycle state transitions working correctly

**Note:** The 7-day window (168 hours) caused the script to hang due to processing too much data. The 24-hour window works reliably.

### Test Data Creation

Created test dormant narratives to verify resurrection logic:

**Script:** `scripts/create_test_dormant_narratives.py`
- âœ… Converted 5 narratives to dormant state
- âœ… Set last_updated to 10 days ago
- âœ… Added dormant state to lifecycle_history

**Script:** `scripts/add_articles_to_dormant_narratives.py`
- âœ… Added recent articles to dormant narratives
- âœ… Updated 5 narratives with 31, 2, 8, 1, and 2 new articles respectively

### Resurrection Detection

After running narrative detection again:
- âœ… 3 narratives transitioned to "reactivated" state
- âœ… Narratives then transitioned to "hot" state (sustained activity)
- âœ… Resurrection metrics properly tracked:
  - `reawakening_count`: 1 for all 3 narratives
  - `reawakened_from`: Timestamp when narrative went dormant
  - `resurrection_velocity`: Articles per day during reactivation

**Final State:**
```
Lifecycle states:
  - emerging: 19
  - hot: 95
  - rising: 6
  - dormant: 2
  - None: 36

Narratives with reawakening_count > 0: 3
```

## 2. API Verification âœ…

### Resurrections Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/narratives/resurrections?limit=10&days=7`

**Initial Issue:** API returned empty array `[]`

**Root Cause:** Query was filtering by `reawakened_from` (when narrative went dormant) instead of `last_updated` (when resurrection occurred). Since `reawakened_from` was 10 days ago (outside the 7-day window), no results were returned.

**Fix Applied:** Updated query in `src/crypto_news_aggregator/db/operations/narratives.py` to use `last_updated` instead of `reawakened_from`.

**After Fix:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/narratives/resurrections?limit=10&days=7"
```

**Results:** âœ… Returns 3 resurrected narratives

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "title": "Crypto Markets Face Volatility, Systemic Risk Concerns",
  "article_count": 4,
  "mention_velocity": 5.15,
  "lifecycle": "hot",
  "lifecycle_state": "hot",
  "lifecycle_history": [
    {
      "state": "hot",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-15T23:50:31.319000",
      "article_count": 4,
      "velocity": 4.0
    },
    {
      "state": "dormant",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-06T18:11:04.733000",
      "article_count": 6,
      "velocity": 0.0
    },
    {
      "state": "reactivated",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-16T18:15:00.258000",
      "article_count": 4,
      "velocity": 5.22
    },
    {
      "state": "hot",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-16T18:17:33.364000",
      "article_count": 4,
      "velocity": 5.2
    }
  ],
  "reawakening_count": 1,
  "reawakened_from": "2025-10-06T18:11:04.733000",
  "resurrection_velocity": 10.43
}
```

**Verified Fields:**
- âœ… `reawakening_count`: Number of times narrative has been reactivated
- âœ… `reawakened_from`: Timestamp when narrative went dormant
- âœ… `resurrection_velocity`: Articles per day during reactivation
- âœ… `lifecycle_history`: Complete state transition history

**All 3 Resurrected Narratives:**
1. "Crypto Markets Face Volatility, Systemic Risk Concerns" (reawakening_count: 1)
2. "Investors Flee to Gold and Crypto Amid Economic Volatility" (reawakening_count: 1)
3. "SEC Navigates Balancing Crypto Regulation and Innovation" (reawakening_count: 1)

## 3. Frontend Verification ðŸ”„

### Server Status

**Command:** `npm run dev` (in context-owl-ui directory)

**Status:** âœ… Running on http://localhost:5174

**Browser Preview:** Available at http://127.0.0.1:62082

### Manual Testing Checklist

Please verify the following in the browser at http://localhost:5174:

#### Archive Tab
- [ ] Click the "Archive" tab in the navigation
- [ ] Verify the tab loads without errors

#### Resurrection Summary Card
- [ ] Verify the resurrection summary card appears at the top
- [ ] Check that it shows "Total Resurrections: 3"
- [ ] Verify it displays the top 3 resurrected narratives:
  - "Crypto Markets Face Volatility, Systemic Risk Concerns"
  - "Investors Flee to Gold and Crypto Amid Economic Volatility"
  - "SEC Navigates Balancing Crypto Regulation and Innovation"

#### Narrative Cards
- [ ] Verify narrative cards display in the Archive tab
- [ ] Check for gold "Reawakened" badges on resurrected narratives
- [ ] Verify badges show reawakening count (e.g., "Reawakened Ã—1")
- [ ] Check that "Dormant since" dates appear in card footers
- [ ] Verify dates are formatted correctly (e.g., "Oct 6, 2025")

#### Visual Elements
- [ ] Check that the resurrection summary card has proper styling
- [ ] Verify the gold badge color (#f59e0b or similar)
- [ ] Check that card layouts are responsive
- [ ] Verify no console errors in browser DevTools

## 4. Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Resurrections API Returning Empty Array

**Problem:** API query filtered by `reawakened_from` (when narrative went dormant) instead of when resurrection occurred.

**Solution:** Updated `get_resurrected_narratives()` in `src/crypto_news_aggregator/db/operations/narratives.py` to query by `last_updated` instead of `reawakened_from`.

**File Changed:** `src/crypto_news_aggregator/db/operations/narratives.py`

**Code Change:**
```python
# Before
query = {
    "reawakening_count": {"$gt": 0},
    "reawakened_from": {"$gte": cutoff_date}
}

# After
query = {
    "reawakening_count": {"$gt": 0},
    "last_updated": {"$gte": cutoff_date}
}
```

### Issue #2: Narrative Detection Hanging on 7-Day Window

**Problem:** Running `trigger_narrative_detection.py --hours 168` caused the script to hang.

**Workaround:** Use 24-hour window (`--hours 24`) for testing. The 7-day window processes too much data and may need optimization for production use.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding progress indicators or batch processing for large time windows.

---

## 5. Test Scripts Created

### `scripts/create_test_dormant_narratives.py`
- Converts existing narratives to dormant state for testing
- Sets last_updated to 10 days ago
- Adds dormant state to lifecycle_history
- Usage: `poetry run python scripts/create_test_dormant_narratives.py --count 5`

### `scripts/add_articles_to_dormant_narratives.py`
- Adds recent articles to dormant narratives
- Triggers lifecycle state updates
- Usage: `poetry run python scripts/add_articles_to_dormant_narratives.py`

---

## 6. Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Manual UI Testing:** Complete the frontend verification checklist above
2. **Visual Verification:** Check that all UI elements match the design specifications
3. **Browser Testing:** Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Future Improvements
1. **Performance:** Optimize narrative detection for larger time windows (7+ days)
2. **Progress Indicators:** Add progress feedback for long-running detection jobs
3. **Batch Processing:** Implement chunked processing for large article sets
4. **Automated UI Tests:** Add Playwright tests for Archive tab functionality
