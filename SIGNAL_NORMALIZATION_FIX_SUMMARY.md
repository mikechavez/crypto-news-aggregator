# Entity Normalization Signal Fix - Complete Summary

## Executive Summary

**Fixed production bug where duplicate entities appeared in UI** ("$DOGE" and "Dogecoin" as separate signals instead of one merged entity).

**Root Cause:** Signal calculation pipeline grouped by raw entity names instead of canonical names.

**Solution:** Normalize entity names before grouping in signal calculation, add defensive normalization in signal service, and provide migration script to clean up existing duplicates.

## Technical Details

### The Bug

```python
# OLD CODE (worker.py lines 50-62)
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"created_at": {"$gte": thirty_min_ago}, "is_primary": True}},
    {"$group": {
        "_id": {
            "entity": "$entity",  # ❌ Groups by raw name
            "entity_type": "$entity_type"
        }
    }},
]
```

**Problem:** Even though entity_mentions were normalized when created, the aggregation pipeline grouped by the raw entity name from the database. If any old data existed with variants, it created separate signal scores.

### The Fix

```python
# NEW CODE (worker.py lines 51-78)
# Fetch all recent primary entity mentions
cursor = entity_mentions_collection.find({
    "created_at": {"$gte": thirty_min_ago},
    "is_primary": True
})

# Normalize entities and group by canonical name
entity_map = {}  # canonical_name -> entity_type
async for mention in cursor:
    raw_entity = mention.get("entity")
    canonical_entity = normalize_entity_name(raw_entity)  # ✅ Normalize!
    
    if canonical_entity not in entity_map:
        entity_map[canonical_entity] = entity_type
```

**Solution:** Fetch all mentions, normalize each entity name to canonical form in Python, then group by canonical name. This ensures all variants ("$DOGE", "DOGE", "doge", "Dogecoin") map to "Dogecoin".

### Defensive Normalization

Also added normalization in `signal_service.calculate_signal_score()`:

```python
async def calculate_signal_score(entity: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Normalize entity name to canonical form (defensive measure)
    canonical_entity = normalize_entity_name(entity)
    if canonical_entity != entity:
        logger.info(f"Signal score calculation: normalized '{entity}' -> '{canonical_entity}'")
    
    # Use canonical name for all calculations
    velocity = await calculate_velocity(canonical_entity)
    diversity = await calculate_source_diversity(canonical_entity)
    sentiment_metrics = await calculate_sentiment_metrics(canonical_entity)
```

This provides defense-in-depth: even if the worker passes a variant, the signal service normalizes it.

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Create PR
```bash
gh pr create --title "Fix: Entity normalization in signal calculation" \
  --body-file PR_ENTITY_NORMALIZATION_SIGNAL_FIX.md
```

### 2. Review and Merge
- Review code changes
- Verify tests pass in CI
- Merge to main (Railway auto-deploys)

### 3. Run Migration Script
```bash
railway run python scripts/migrate_signal_scores_normalization.py --production
```

### 4. Verify Fix
```bash
# Wait 2 minutes for signal worker
# Check UI: https://context-owl.vercel.app
# Run verification
railway run python scripts/verify_signal_normalization.py
```

## Expected Impact

### Before Fix
```
Top Signals:
#3: "$DOGE" (998% score)      ← Duplicate
#6: "Dogecoin" (998% score)   ← Duplicate
#8: "$BTC" (850% score)       ← Duplicate
#12: "Bitcoin" (850% score)   ← Duplicate
```

### After Fix
```
Top Signals:
#1: "Dogecoin" (998% score)   ← Merged!
#2: "Bitcoin" (850% score)    ← Merged!
```

**Result:** Cleaner UI, accurate signal rankings, no duplicate entities.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** LOW

**Why:**
1. Changes are isolated to signal calculation logic
2. Comprehensive test coverage (5 tests)
3. Migration script is idempotent and safe
4. Signal scores regenerate automatically (no permanent data loss)
5. Easy rollback (revert commit, scores regenerate)

**Mitigation:**
- Dry-run mode for migration script
- Verification script to confirm success
- Detailed deployment guide
- Rollback plan documented

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, verify:

✅ No duplicate entities in UI  
✅ Signal scores grouped by canonical name  
✅ Railway logs show normalization messages  
✅ Verification script passes all checks  
✅ Signal worker runs without errors  
✅ Top signals display correctly  

---

## Timeline

- **Development:** ~2 hours (code + tests + docs)
- **Testing:** ~15 minutes (local tests)
- **PR Review:** ~30 minutes (estimated)
- **Deployment:** ~10 minutes (merge + Railway deploy)
- **Migration:** ~5 minutes (run script)
- **Verification:** ~5 minutes (check UI + logs)

**Total:** ~3 hours from start to production verification

---

## Conclusion

This fix completes the entity normalization work by ensuring signal calculation uses canonical entity names. The solution is:

- **Correct:** Fixes the root cause (grouping by raw names)
- **Complete:** Includes code, tests, migration, and docs
- **Safe:** Low risk with easy rollback
- **Tested:** 5 tests passing, verification script provided
- **Documented:** Comprehensive guides for deployment and troubleshooting

**Ready for PR and production deployment.**
