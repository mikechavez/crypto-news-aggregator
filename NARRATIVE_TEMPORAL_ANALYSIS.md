## 📊 Pattern Analysis

### Narrative Lifecycle Patterns

Based on the data, crypto narratives follow these patterns:

#### **1. Flash News (35.5%)**
- **Span:** < 1 day
- **Velocity:** 5+ articles/day (typically)
- **Example:** Breaking news, announcements
- **Lifecycle:** Emerge → Peak → Fade in hours

#### **2. Hot Topics (38.0%)**
- **Span:** 1-3 days
- **Velocity:** 2-5 articles/day
- **Example:** Market reactions, regulatory news
- **Lifecycle:** Emerge → Hot → Cooling over 2-3 days

#### **3. Trending Stories (24.8%)**
- **Span:** 3-7 days
- **Velocity:** 1-2 articles/day
- **Example:** Ongoing developments, controversies
- **Lifecycle:** Rising → Hot → Cooling over a week

#### **4. Long-Term Narratives (1.7%)**
- **Span:** 30+ days
- **Velocity:** 0.1-0.5 articles/day
- **Example:** Solana ecosystem, market maturity
- **Lifecycle:** Slow burn with occasional spikes

### Velocity vs Duration

```
High Velocity (5+/day)     │ ████████████████████ (38%)
                           │ Mostly < 3 days
                           │
Moderate Velocity (1-5/day)│ ████████████████ (48.7%)
                           │ Mix of 1-7 days
                           │
Low Velocity (<1/day)      │ ███ (13.2%)
                           │ Either < 1 day OR 30+ days
```

**Insight:** High velocity = short duration (breaking news)  
**Exception:** Long-term narratives have low velocity but long duration

## 🔮 Recommendations

### 1. **Monitor Long-Running Narratives**
The 2 narratives spanning 30+ days should be reviewed:
- Solana Liquidity Hub (43 days)
- Crypto Market Reckoning (35 days)

**Action:** Check if they should be archived or continue tracking

### 2. **Optimize for Fast-Moving Stories**
With 73.5% of narratives < 3 days:
- Prioritize real-time matching
- Reduce grace period for older narratives
- Focus UI on recent content

### 3. **Handle Breaking News Better**
38% have explosive velocity (5+ articles/day):
- Implement real-time narrative updates
- Add "breaking" badges for high-velocity narratives
- Prioritize these in UI

### 4. **Archive Strategy**
With 100% active in last 7 days:
- Consider archiving narratives after 14 days of inactivity
- Keep long-term narratives (30+ days) if still active
- Monitor for resurrection patterns

### 5. **Velocity-Based Lifecycle**
Current lifecycle states don't fully capture velocity:
- Add "breaking" state for 5+ articles/day
- Adjust "hot" threshold based on velocity
- Consider velocity in ranking algorithm
