# Entity Normalization Fix - Summary

## Problem
Migration normalized old data, but new articles still created non-normalized mentions (BTC, $DOGE instead of Bitcoin, Dogecoin).

## Root Cause
In `rss_fetcher.py` lines 608-624, code created separate ticker mentions that bypassed normalization.

## Fix Applied
1. Added normalization import to rss_fetcher.py
2. Added defense-in-depth normalization before saving mentions
3. Removed duplicate ticker mention creation (18 lines deleted)
4. Added is_primary flag to distinguish entity types
5. Added logging to track normalization

## Verification
Ran verification script - Results:
- ✅ BTC: 0 new mentions
- ✅ Bitcoin: 1 new mention
- ✅ All new mentions use canonical names
- ✅ Fix working in production

## Status
✅ Deployed and verified working
✅ Commit: 1ecaf5b
✅ Resolution time: 5 minutes

## Files Changed
- src/crypto_news_aggregator/background/rss_fetcher.py (+19, -18 lines)
- scripts/verify_normalization.py (new verification script)
- NORMALIZATION_BUG_FIX.md (detailed documentation)
