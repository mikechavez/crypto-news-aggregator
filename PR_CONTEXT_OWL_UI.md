This PR introduces the **Context Owl UI**, a modern React-based frontend for the Crypto News Aggregator platform. The UI provides real-time visualization of trending entities, narrative clusters, and signal detection.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Signals Dashboard
- Real-time trending entity detection with auto-refresh (30s intervals)
- Signal strength scoring (0-10 scale) with visual indicators
- Velocity metrics and source diversity tracking
- Sentiment analysis visualization
- Entity type filtering and ranking

### ðŸ“– Narratives View
- Narrative clustering with co-occurrence detection
- Story generation for trending themes
- Entity grouping and relationship visualization
- Article count tracking per narrative

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI/UX
- Built with React 19 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Clean, minimal interface
- Auto-refresh capabilities
- Error handling and loading states

## Technical Stack

- **React 19.1.1** - Latest React with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **React Router v7** - Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library

### API Integration
- Axios-based HTTP client with interceptors
- Environment variable validation
- Error handling and retry logic
- TypeScript interfaces matching backend models

## Development Practices Updates
- Added UI development guidelines to `.windsurf/rules/ui-development.md`
- Updated testing standards for UI components
- Enhanced development practices with UI-specific workflows

## Testing
- Manual testing completed for all routes
- API integration verified with backend
- Responsive design tested on multiple viewports
- Error states and loading states validated

## Backend Compatibility
- Matches API endpoints: `/signals`, `/narratives`, `/entities`
- TypeScript interfaces align with Pydantic models
- Handles backend response structures correctly

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Entity detail page (backend endpoints needed)
- [ ] Historical trend charts
- [ ] Alert configuration UI
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Screenshots
The UI provides:
1. **Signals Page** - Trending entities with scores, velocity, and sentiment
2. **Narratives Page** - Clustered themes with stories and entities
3. **Clean Navigation** - Simple tab-based routing

## Deployment Notes
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Output: `dist/` directory
- Can be served statically or via CDN
- Requires backend API to be accessible

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a new addition to the project.

## Related Issues
