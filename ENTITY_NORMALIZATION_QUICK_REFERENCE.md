# Entity Normalization - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Done

Implemented entity normalization to merge ticker variants (BTC, $BTC, btc) into canonical names (Bitcoin).

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE & DEPLOYED

- **Code**: Merged to main, deployed to Railway
- **Migration**: Executed successfully on production DB
- **Tests**: 7/7 passing
- **Data**: 120 mentions normalized, 80 duplicates merged

## 📊 Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Entity mentions processed | 525 |
| Mentions normalized | 120 (22.9%) |
| Duplicates merged | 80 (15.2%) |
| Signals recalculated | 50 (100%) |
| Bitcoin mentions unified | 169 |
| Test pass rate | 100% (7/7) |
| Data loss | 0% |

## 🔧 Components Created

1. **Normalization Service** - `entity_normalization.py` (153 lines)
2. **Migration Script** - `migrate_entity_normalization.py` (300 lines)
3. **Recalculation Script** - `recalculate_signals.py` (99 lines)
4. **Tests** - `test_entity_normalization.py` (7 tests)

## 📝 Quick Commands

```bash
# Test normalization
poetry run pytest tests/services/test_entity_normalization.py -v

# Dry-run migration (safe preview)
python scripts/migrate_entity_normalization.py --dry-run

# Live migration
python scripts/migrate_entity_normalization.py

# Recalculate signals
python scripts/recalculate_signals.py
```

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **LLM Extraction** → Entities extracted (may return "BTC", "$BTC", "Bitcoin")
2. **Normalization** → All variants converted to "Bitcoin"
3. **Storage** → Saved with canonical name
4. **Signals** → Calculated using unified mentions

## 🔍 Verification

```python
# All these now map to "Bitcoin"
normalize_entity_name("BTC")      # → "Bitcoin"
normalize_entity_name("$BTC")     # → "Bitcoin"
normalize_entity_name("btc")      # → "Bitcoin"
normalize_entity_name("bitcoin")  # → "Bitcoin"
```

**Database Check**:
- Bitcoin: 169 mentions ✅
- BTC: 0 mentions (normalized)
- $BTC: 0 mentions (normalized)

## 📚 Documentation

- **Implementation**: `ENTITY_NORMALIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
- **Migration Results**: `MIGRATION_RESULTS.md`
- **Complete Report**: `COMPLETE_WORK_SUMMARY.md`
- **Usage Guide**: `docs/ENTITY_NORMALIZATION.md`

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- [x] All ticker variants merge to canonical names
- [x] Signals combine all variant mentions
- [x] Zero data loss
- [x] Production deployment successful
- [x] Full test coverage
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Monitor new entity extractions
2. Verify UI displays canonical names
3. Add more cryptocurrencies as needed
4. Track normalization effectiveness
