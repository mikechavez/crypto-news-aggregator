# Benzinga Narrative Removal - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Branch:** `fix/remove-benzinga-narrative`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for PR

## Problem

Benzinga advertising narratives were being created from promotional content, cluttering the narrative feed with irrelevant "financial insights" articles that are not actual crypto news narratives.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Entity Blacklist System

Added a blacklist mechanism to prevent specific entities from becoming narrative nucleus entities:

**File:** `src/crypto_news_aggregator/services/narrative_service.py`

```python
# Blacklist of entities that should not become narrative nucleus entities
# These are typically advertising/promotional content or irrelevant entities
BLACKLIST_ENTITIES = {'Benzinga', 'Sarah Edwards'}
```

**Implementation:** Lines 670-674
- Checks nucleus_entity against blacklist after fingerprint computation
- Skips narrative creation/matching if entity is blacklisted
- Logs when a blacklisted entity is skipped

### 2. One-Time Cleanup Script

**File:** `scripts/delete_benzinga_narrative.py`

**Features:**
- Queries for narratives with title containing "Benzinga" AND nucleus_entity="Benzinga"
- Displays full narrative details before deletion
- Dry-run mode by default (safe preview)
- `--confirm` flag required for actual deletion
- Interactive "DELETE" confirmation prompt
- Optional `--update-articles` flag to remove narrative associations

**Usage:**
```bash
# Preview what will be deleted
poetry run python scripts/delete_benzinga_narrative.py

# Actually delete the narrative
poetry run python scripts/delete_benzinga_narrative.py --confirm

# Also remove narrative associations from articles
poetry run python scripts/delete_benzinga_narrative.py --confirm --update-articles
```

## Execution Results

### Narratives Deleted
1. **ID:** `68eb37195dff4acd889dc685`
   - Title: "Benzinga Delivers Financial Insights Across Diverse Sectors"
   - Article Count: 7
   - First Seen: 2025-10-12 05:05:29
   - Last Updated: 2025-10-18 19:32:04

2. **ID:** `68f32d3f7082f49df56956cc`
   - Title: "Benzinga Delivers Financial Insights Across Diverse Sectors"
   - Article Count: 7
   - First Seen: 2025-10-18 06:01:35
   - Last Updated: 2025-10-18 19:32:01
   - *Note: This was created by a recent detection run after the first deletion*

### Sample Articles Affected
- "Best Options Trading Platforms"
- "Best Online Brokers for Bonds in October 2025"
- "Top Performing Defensive Stocks"
- "Top Performing High Short Interest Stocks"
- "Top Performing Stocks"

All 7 articles remain in the database and will be re-clustered in the next narrative detection run (or remain unclustered if they don't fit other narratives).

## Commits

1. **ccacad9** - `fix: add Benzinga narrative cleanup script and blacklist`
   - Created cleanup script
   - Added BLACKLIST_ENTITIES constant
   - Added blacklist check in narrative detection

2. **ba1b62b** - `fix: correct MongoManager API call in cleanup script`
   - Fixed `connect()` → `initialize()` method call

## Testing

✅ Script tested in dry-run mode  
✅ Script executed successfully with --confirm flag  
✅ Verified both Benzinga narratives deleted  
✅ Confirmed no Benzinga narratives remain in database  
✅ Blacklist check added to prevent future creation  

## Next Steps

1. **Create Pull Request** to merge `fix/remove-benzinga-narrative` into `main`
2. **Deploy to Railway** after PR approval
3. **Monitor** next narrative detection run to ensure:
   - No new Benzinga narratives are created
   - Blacklist logging appears in logs when Benzinga entities are encountered

## Future Enhancements

If more advertising/promotional entities are discovered, simply add them to the `BLACKLIST_ENTITIES` set in `narrative_service.py`:

```python
BLACKLIST_ENTITIES = {'Benzinga', 'Sarah Edwards', 'NewEntity'}
```

No other code changes needed - the blacklist check is already in place.
