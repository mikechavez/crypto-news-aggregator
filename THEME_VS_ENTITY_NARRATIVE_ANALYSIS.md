# Theme-Based vs Entity-Based Narrative Analysis

## Summary

**Total Narratives:** 227
- **Theme-Based:** 15 (6.6%)
- **Entity-Based:** 212 (93.4%)

## Categorization Logic

A narrative is classified as **theme-based** if its `nucleus_entity` (from `fingerprint.nucleus_entity` or `theme` field):

1. **Contains underscores** - indicating compound themes (e.g., `nft_gaming`, `layer2_scaling`, `defi_adoption`)
2. **Is a generic lowercase term** - without proper capitalization (e.g., `regulatory`, `payments`, `security`, `infrastructure`, `stablecoin`, `technology`, `partnerships`, `institutional_investment`, `market_analysis`)

Entity-based narratives have proper capitalization indicating specific entities (e.g., `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum`, `Solana`, `SEC`, `Coinbase`).

### Example Entity-Based Narratives:

**1. Bitcoin**
- 25 narratives total
- Various states (hot, emerging, cooling)
- Focus on specific Bitcoin-related events and price movements

**2. Ethereum**
- 8 narratives total
- Primarily emerging state
- Focus on Ethereum-specific developments

## Backfill Scope

### Narratives Requiring Theme-Based Fingerprint Generation:
**15 narratives** need to have their fingerprints regenerated using theme-based logic.

These narratives currently have fingerprints generated with entity-based logic (focusing on specific actors and actions), but should instead use theme-based logic that:
- Identifies broader thematic patterns
- Focuses on concepts and trends rather than specific entities
- Captures cross-entity themes and narratives

### Narratives with Correct Entity-Based Fingerprints:
**212 narratives** already have appropriate entity-based fingerprints and require no changes.

## Key Observations

1. **Small Theme-Based Population**: Only 6.6% of narratives are theme-based, suggesting most narratives focus on specific entities rather than broader themes.

2. **Theme-Based Narratives are Cooling**: 14 of 15 theme-based narratives are in "cooling" state, suggesting they may be older or less actively discussed.

3. **Entity-Based Narratives are Active**: The majority of entity-based narratives are in "hot" (121) or "emerging" (66) states, indicating active discussion.

4. **Bitcoin Dominance**: Bitcoin has the most entity-based narratives (25), followed by Ethereum (8) and Ripple (7).

5. **Compound Themes**: Theme-based narratives with underscores (`layer2_scaling`, `nft_gaming`, `defi_adoption`) clearly indicate multi-concept themes.

6. **Generic Terms**: Single-word lowercase themes (`payments`, `security`, `infrastructure`, `regulatory`) represent broad industry concepts rather than specific entities.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Confirm categorization logic** - Review the 15 theme-based examples to ensure categorization is accurate
2. **Run backfill script** - Generate theme-based fingerprints for the 15 identified narratives
3. **Verify fingerprint quality** - Check that new fingerprints properly capture thematic patterns
4. **Monitor impact** - Track how theme-based fingerprints affect narrative matching and clustering
