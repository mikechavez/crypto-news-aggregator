# Timeline View - Final Visual Inspection Report

**Date:** October 16, 2025, 8:35 AM  
**URL:** http://localhost:5174  
**Backend:** http://localhost:8000  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Both servers running

## Data Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Excellent Variety Now Available

**Lifecycle Distribution:**
- üî• **Hot (orange):** 4 narratives - Flame icon
- üìà **Rising (green):** 6 narratives - TrendingUp icon

**Duration Range:**
- **Min:** 0.0 hours (very short bars)
- **Max:** 14.7 hours (longer bars)
- **Variation:** 14.7 hours - **GOOD for visual testing**

**Article Count Range:**
- **Min:** 3 articles (60% opacity)
- **Max:** 63 articles (90% opacity)

## Expected Visual Appearance

### 1. ‚úÖ Bar Width Variation - SHOULD BE VISIBLE

With 14.7 hours of variation, we should see:
- **Very short bars:** Narratives with 0-3 hour duration
- **Medium bars:** Narratives with 3-8 hour duration  
- **Longer bars:** Narratives with 10-15 hour duration

**Expected:** At least 3-4 distinctly different bar widths

### 2. ‚úÖ Lifecycle Badge Variety - SHOULD BE VISIBLE

**Expected to see:**
- üî• **Flame icons (orange)** on 4 narratives - "hot" lifecycle
- üìà **TrendingUp icons (green)** on 6 narratives - "rising" lifecycle

**Color scheme:**
- Hot: Orange text/background (`text-orange-500`, `from-orange-400 to-orange-600`)
- Rising: Green text/background (`text-green-500`, `from-blue-500 to-green-500`)

### 3. ‚úÖ Gradient Colors - TWO TYPES

**Expected gradients:**
- **Hot bars:** Orange gradient (`from-orange-400 to-orange-600`)
- **Rising bars:** Blue-to-green gradient (`from-blue-500 to-green-500`)

### 4. ‚úÖ Opacity Variation

Based on article counts (3-63):
- **60% opacity:** Narratives with 3-6 articles
- **75% opacity:** Narratives with 7-10 articles
- **90% opacity:** Narratives with 11+ articles (including the 63-article one)

### 5. ‚úÖ Peak Markers

White triangle markers should appear on bars where articles are concentrated on specific days.

## Detailed Visual Inspection Checklist

### Step 1: Navigate to Timeline View
- [ ] Open http://localhost:5174 in browser
- [ ] Click "Narratives" in navigation
- [ ] Click "Pulse" button to switch to timeline view
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors

### Step 2: Check Bar Width Variation ‚úÖ
**What to look for:**
- [ ] Timeline shows 10 horizontal bars
- [ ] Bars have **visibly different widths** (not all the same)
- [ ] At least 3-4 distinct width categories visible
- [ ] Bars are aligned to a common timeline (date range shown at top)

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Should see varied widths from short to long

### Step 3: Check Lifecycle Badges ‚úÖ
**What to look for:**
- [ ] Each narrative has an icon next to its title
- [ ] See **two different icon types:**
  - üî• Flame (orange) - appears on ~4 narratives
  - üìà TrendingUp arrow (green) - appears on ~6 narratives
- [ ] Icons are properly colored and sized
- [ ] Icons align with narrative titles

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Should see mix of orange flames and green arrows

### Step 4: Check Gradient Colors ‚úÖ
**What to look for:**
- [ ] Timeline bars have gradient backgrounds (not solid colors)
- [ ] **Orange gradient bars** (hot narratives) - smooth orange transition
- [ ] **Blue-to-green gradient bars** (rising narratives) - color shift visible
- [ ] Gradients render smoothly without banding

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Should see two distinct gradient styles

### Step 5: Check Opacity Variation ‚úÖ
**What to look for:**
- [ ] Some bars appear more transparent than others
- [ ] The 63-article narrative should be most opaque (90%)
- [ ] 3-article narratives should be more transparent (60%)
- [ ] Opacity creates visual hierarchy

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Should see subtle opacity differences

### Step 6: Check Peak Markers ‚ö†Ô∏è
**What to look for:**
- [ ] Small white triangles appear above some bars
- [ ] Triangles positioned at specific points along the bar
- [ ] Triangles indicate peak activity days

**Expected Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MAY NOT BE VISIBLE if articles are evenly distributed

### Step 7: Test Hover Tooltip ‚úÖ
**Actions:**
- [ ] Hover mouse over any timeline bar
- [ ] Tooltip appears below the bar
- [ ] Tooltip shows:
  - ‚úÖ Narrative title
  - ‚úÖ Start date (format: "Oct 16, 2025")
  - ‚úÖ Latest date
  - ‚úÖ Article count (3-63)
  - ‚úÖ Stage ("hot" or "rising")
  - ‚úÖ Velocity (e.g., "31.5 per day")
- [ ] Tooltip has dark background with white text
- [ ] Tooltip fades in smoothly
- [ ] Tooltip disappears when mouse moves away

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Tooltip should work perfectly

### Step 8: Test Click to Expand Modal ‚úÖ
**Actions:**
- [ ] Click on any timeline bar
- [ ] Modal opens with dark backdrop covering screen
- [ ] Modal contains:
  - ‚úÖ Large narrative title
  - ‚úÖ Lifecycle badge (hot/rising)
  - ‚úÖ Article count
  - ‚úÖ Date range
  - ‚úÖ Summary text (if available)
  - ‚úÖ Entity tags (blue pills)
  - ‚úÖ List of articles with clickable links
  - ‚úÖ Close button (X) in top-right
- [ ] Click X button to close modal
- [ ] Click outside modal (on backdrop) to close
- [ ] Modal closes smoothly

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Modal should work perfectly

### Step 9: Test Animations ‚úÖ
**What to look for:**
- [ ] Bars animate in from left (width grows from 0 to final width)
- [ ] Rows fade in and slide from left
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60fps)
- [ ] Hover effect: bars scale up slightly (1.05x)
- [ ] No jank or stuttering

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Animations should be smooth

### Step 10: Check Overall Design Polish ‚úÖ
**Design elements to verify:**
- [ ] **Alignment:** All bars aligned to common timeline
- [ ] **Spacing:** Adequate gap between rows (not cramped)
- [ ] **Typography:** Clear, readable font sizes
- [ ] **Colors:** Good contrast, visually appealing
- [ ] **Icons:** Crisp, properly sized (16px)
- [ ] **Borders:** Smooth rounded corners
- [ ] **Shadows:** Subtle elevation on hover
- [ ] **Responsive:** Layout adapts to window width
- [ ] **Dark mode:** Colors work in both light/dark themes

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PASS - Should look professional and polished
