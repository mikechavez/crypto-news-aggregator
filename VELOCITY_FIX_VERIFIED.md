# Velocity Calculation Fix - VERIFIED ✅

## Summary

The velocity calculation bug has been **fixed and verified** on the dev server. The fix correctly calculates velocity as `articles_in_last_7_days / 7`.

## Verification Results

### Test Run Output
```
[VELOCITY DEBUG] ========== VELOCITY CALCULATION START ==========
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Total articles: 2
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Current time (now): 2025-10-17 03:42:37+00:00 (UTC)
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Cutoff date (7 days ago): 2025-10-10 03:42:37+00:00 (UTC)
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Time delta calculation: (now - cutoff).total_seconds() / 86400
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Time delta result: 7.00 days
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Time delta in seconds: 604800 seconds
[VELOCITY DEBUG] All article dates (sorted):
[VELOCITY DEBUG]   [1] 2025-10-15 13:04:15+00:00 ✓ IN WINDOW

[VELOCITY DEBUG] Article span: 0.05 days
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Final calculation: 2 articles / 7 days
[VELOCITY DEBUG] Result: 0.29 articles/day
[VELOCITY DEBUG] ========== VELOCITY CALCULATION END ==========
```

### API Response (New Narratives)
```json
{
  "title": "Taiwanese Stablecoin Firm OwlTing Debuts on Nasdaq",
  "article_count": 2,
  "mention_velocity": 0.29,  ← CORRECT! (2/7 = 0.29)
  "last_updated": "2025-10-17T03:42:51.080000"
}
```

### Comparison: Old vs New

| Narrative | Articles | OLD Velocity | NEW Velocity | Correct? |
|-----------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Shiba Inu (old) | 3 | 5.6/day | - | ✗ (from buggy code) |
| OwlTing (new) | 2 | - | 0.29/day | ✓ (2/7 = 0.29) |
| SBF (new) | 2 | - | 0.29/day | ✓ (2/7 = 0.29) |
| Bitwise (new) | 2 | - | 0.29/day | ✓ (2/7 = 0.29) |

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Buggy Code)
```python
oldest_recent = min(recent_articles)
time_span_days = (now - oldest_recent).total_seconds() / 86400
return len(recent_articles) / time_span_days  # WRONG!
```

**Problem:** Divided by actual article span (0.5-2 days) instead of 7-day window.

### After (Fixed Code)
```python
return len(recent_articles) / lookback_days  # CORRECT!
```

**Result:** Always divides by 7 days, giving accurate "articles per day over last 7 days".

## Debug Logging Added

The fix includes comprehensive debug logging that shows:
1. **Current time** and **cutoff date** (7 days ago)
2. **Time delta calculation** (always 7.00 days)
3. **All article dates** with ✓/✗ indicators for window inclusion
4. **Articles within window** count
5. **Final calculation** formula and result

## Old Narratives

Existing narratives in the database still have incorrect velocities (5.6, 10, etc.) because they were calculated with the old buggy code. These will be automatically corrected when:
- New articles are added to the narrative
- The narrative is updated during the next detection cycle
- Or you can run a backfill script to recalculate all velocities

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Fix implemented** - Code corrected
2. ✅ **Tests passing** - 9/9 test cases pass
3. ✅ **Verified on dev** - Debug logs confirm correct calculation
4. ⏳ **Deploy to production** - Push to Railway
5. ⏳ **Monitor logs** - Verify in production
6. ⏳ **Backfill old narratives** - Optional: recalculate existing velocities

## Deployment

The fix is on branch `fix/velocity-calculation-time-window` and ready to deploy:

```bash
# Option 1: Deploy feature branch to Railway manually
# (via Railway dashboard)

# Option 2: Merge to main for automatic deployment
git checkout main
git merge fix/velocity-calculation-time-window
git push origin main
```

## Files Changed

- `src/crypto_news_aggregator/services/narrative_service.py` - Fixed calculation + debug logging
- `tests/services/test_velocity_calculation.py` - Comprehensive test suite (9 tests)
- `VELOCITY_CALCULATION_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation

## Conclusion

✅ **Bug fixed and verified**  
✅ **New narratives show correct velocity**  
✅ **Debug logging in place for monitoring**  
⏳ **Ready for production deployment**
