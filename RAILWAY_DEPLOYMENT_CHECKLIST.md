# Railway Deployment Checklist - Entity Extraction Fix

## ‚úÖ Local Testing Results
- **Status:** All tests passed
- **Model Used:** `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (Haiku 3.5)
- **API Key:** Valid and has access to Haiku 3.5
- **Entity Extraction:** Working correctly

## üöÄ Railway Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment via Git Integration

**Railway handles deployments automatically** when code is pushed to the main branch. No manual deployment steps are required.

#### How Railway Auto-Deployment Works:
1. **Git Integration**: Railway is connected to this repository's main branch
2. **Automatic Builds**: Railway automatically builds and deploys when changes are pushed to main
3. **Zero-Config**: Uses the existing `Procfile` for process definitions
4. **Environment Variables**: Railway dashboard manages all environment variables

#### Removed Redundant GitHub Actions Deployment
- **Previous Issue**: GitHub Actions had a redundant `railway-deploy` step causing authentication errors
- **Resolution**: Removed the deploy job from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Result**: Cleaner CI pipeline that focuses only on testing and code quality

### Simplified CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow is optimized for **speed and simplicity** while maintaining quality:

#### **What We Kept (The Good Stuff)**
1. **Poetry dependency caching** - Massive time saver on repeated runs
2. **Skip tests on doc-only changes** - No unnecessary CI runs
3. **Run stable tests only** - Focus on reliable tests that matter
4. **Linting integration** - Code quality checks before testing

#### **What We Removed (The Overhead)**
1. **Complex parallel jobs** - Too much coordination overhead
2. **pytest-xdist** - Parallel test overhead > benefit for small suite
3. **Matrix strategies** - Single Python version is sufficient
4. **Multiple MongoDB configurations** - Simple is faster

#### **Current Pipeline Structure**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Pull Request] --> B{Src/Tests Changed?}
    B -->|No| C[Skip CI]
    B -->|Yes| D[Lint + Unit Tests]
    D --> E[Integration Tests]
```

#### **Job Breakdown**
- **lint-and-unit-tests**: Pre-commit hooks + unit tests (fast, sequential)
- **integration-tests**: Integration tests only if lint+unit pass

#### **Performance Focus**
- **Single Python version** (3.13) - No matrix overhead
- **Sequential execution** - Simple dependency chain
- **Smart caching** - Poetry dependencies cached by lock file hash
- **Early exit** - Paths-ignore prevents unnecessary runs

#### **Expected Performance**
- **Target**: 2-3 minutes total CI runtime
- **Key wins**: Caching + early exits + simple structure
- **Quality**: Same linting and test coverage, much faster

### Deployment Verification
Railway deployments are verified through:
1. **Railway Dashboard**: Monitor build logs and deployment status
2. **Railway CLI**: `railway logs` to view application logs
3. **Railway URL**: Test the deployed application at your Railway domain


**Success Pattern:**
```
INFO - Attempting entity extraction with Haiku 3.5 (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022)
INFO - Successfully extracted entities using Haiku 3.5
INFO - Batch metrics: articles_processed=10, entities_extracted=28
```

**Fallback Pattern (if 403 occurs):**
```
ERROR - Anthropic API request failed for Haiku 3.5: Status 403, Response: {...}
WARNING - 403 Forbidden for Haiku 3.5, trying fallback model...
INFO - Attempting entity extraction with Sonnet 3.5 (Fallback)
INFO - Successfully extracted entities using Sonnet 3.5 (Fallback)
```

### 4. Trigger Entity Extraction
Test the deployed service:

```bash
# Get your Railway URL
RAILWAY_URL="https://your-app.railway.app"

# Trigger enrichment
curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/v1/tasks/trigger-enrichment \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If 403 Still Occurs on Railway

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Different API Key:** Railway might be using a different API key than local
2. **API Key Permissions:** The Railway API key might not have Haiku 3.5 access
3. **Environment Variable Not Set:** Check Railway dashboard for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Verification Steps:**

1. **Check Railway Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```

2. **Check Railway Logs for API Key:**
   Look for the masked key in logs:
   ```
   ‚úì ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set: sk-ant-...xyz
   ```

3. **Compare API Keys:**
   - Local: Check your `.env` file
   - Railway: Check Railway dashboard
   - Ensure they're the same key

4. **Test API Key Directly:**
   ```bash
   # Test with Railway's API key
   curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     -H "x-api-key: $RAILWAY_API_KEY" \
     -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
       "max_tokens": 100,
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
     }'
   ```

### If Fallback is Always Used

If logs show fallback is consistently used:
1. Update `ANTHROPIC_ENTITY_MODEL` to use Sonnet directly
2. Update cost settings to reflect Sonnet pricing:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_ENTITY_INPUT_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS=0.003
   ANTHROPIC_ENTITY_OUTPUT_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS=0.015
   ```

## üìä Cost Monitoring

**Haiku 3.5 (Preferred):**
- Input: $0.0008/1K tokens
- Output: $0.004/1K tokens
- Example batch (10 articles): ~$0.002-0.005

**Sonnet 3.5 (Fallback):**
- Input: $0.003/1K tokens (3.75x more)
- Output: $0.015/1K tokens (3.75x more)
- Example batch (10 articles): ~$0.008-0.020
