# Railway Deployment Checklist - Entity Extraction Fix

## ✅ Local Testing Results
- **Status:** All tests passed
- **Model Used:** `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (Haiku 3.5)
- **API Key:** Valid and has access to Haiku 3.5
- **Entity Extraction:** Working correctly

## 🚀 Railway Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment via Git Integration

**Railway handles deployments automatically** when code is pushed to the main branch. No manual deployment steps are required.

#### How Railway Auto-Deployment Works:
1. **Git Integration**: Railway is connected to this repository's main branch
2. **Automatic Builds**: Railway automatically builds and deploys when changes are pushed to main
3. **Zero-Config**: Uses the existing `Procfile` for process definitions
4. **Environment Variables**: Railway dashboard manages all environment variables

#### Removed Redundant GitHub Actions Deployment
- **Previous Issue**: GitHub Actions had a redundant `railway-deploy` step causing authentication errors
- **Resolution**: Removed the deploy job from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Result**: Cleaner CI pipeline that focuses only on testing and code quality

### Updated CI/CD Pipeline
The GitHub Actions workflow now:
- ✅ Runs comprehensive test suites on all PRs and pushes
- ✅ Performs code quality checks and linting
- ✅ **No longer attempts Railway deployment** (handled by Railway's Git integration)
- ✅ Eliminates authentication issues with redundant deployment steps

### Deployment Verification
Railway deployments are verified through:
1. **Railway Dashboard**: Monitor build logs and deployment status
2. **Railway CLI**: `railway logs` to view application logs
3. **Railway URL**: Test the deployed application at your Railway domain


**Success Pattern:**
```
INFO - Attempting entity extraction with Haiku 3.5 (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022)
INFO - Successfully extracted entities using Haiku 3.5
INFO - Batch metrics: articles_processed=10, entities_extracted=28
```

**Fallback Pattern (if 403 occurs):**
```
ERROR - Anthropic API request failed for Haiku 3.5: Status 403, Response: {...}
WARNING - 403 Forbidden for Haiku 3.5, trying fallback model...
INFO - Attempting entity extraction with Sonnet 3.5 (Fallback)
INFO - Successfully extracted entities using Sonnet 3.5 (Fallback)
```

### 4. Trigger Entity Extraction
Test the deployed service:

```bash
# Get your Railway URL
RAILWAY_URL="https://your-app.railway.app"

# Trigger enrichment
curl -X POST $RAILWAY_URL/api/v1/tasks/trigger-enrichment \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If 403 Still Occurs on Railway

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Different API Key:** Railway might be using a different API key than local
2. **API Key Permissions:** The Railway API key might not have Haiku 3.5 access
3. **Environment Variable Not Set:** Check Railway dashboard for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Verification Steps:**

1. **Check Railway Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```

2. **Check Railway Logs for API Key:**
   Look for the masked key in logs:
   ```
   ✓ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set: sk-ant-...xyz
   ```

3. **Compare API Keys:**
   - Local: Check your `.env` file
   - Railway: Check Railway dashboard
   - Ensure they're the same key

4. **Test API Key Directly:**
   ```bash
   # Test with Railway's API key
   curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     -H "x-api-key: $RAILWAY_API_KEY" \
     -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
       "max_tokens": 100,
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
     }'
   ```

### If Fallback is Always Used

If logs show fallback is consistently used:
1. Update `ANTHROPIC_ENTITY_MODEL` to use Sonnet directly
2. Update cost settings to reflect Sonnet pricing:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_ENTITY_INPUT_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS=0.003
   ANTHROPIC_ENTITY_OUTPUT_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS=0.015
   ```

## 📊 Cost Monitoring

**Haiku 3.5 (Preferred):**
- Input: $0.0008/1K tokens
- Output: $0.004/1K tokens
- Example batch (10 articles): ~$0.002-0.005

**Sonnet 3.5 (Fallback):**
- Input: $0.003/1K tokens (3.75x more)
- Output: $0.015/1K tokens (3.75x more)
- Example batch (10 articles): ~$0.008-0.020
