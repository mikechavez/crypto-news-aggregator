# 2. Deleted articles and entity mentions
poetry run python scripts/delete_recent_benzinga.py --confirm --hours 720

# 3. Cleaned up stale signal scores
poetry run python scripts/cleanup_stale_signals.py --execute

# 4. Cleaned up orphaned entity mentions

```

## Final Database State

```
=== FINAL VERIFICATION ===
Benzinga articles: 0
Benzinga entity mentions: 0
Total articles: 2485
Total entity mentions: 10031
Total signal scores: 475
```

## Technical Details

### Issue Found
The initial script was looking for `source.id = "benzinga"` but articles actually store source as a simple string field: `source = "benzinga"`.

### Fix Applied
Updated the query in `get_recent_benzinga_articles()`:
```python
# Before (incorrect)
query = {
    "source.id": "benzinga",
    "published_at": {"$gte": cutoff_time}
}

# After (correct)
query = {
    "source": "benzinga",
    "published_at": {"$gte": cutoff_time}
}
```

### Deletion Flow

1. **Query articles** - Found 10 Benzinga articles from last 30 days
2. **Delete entity_mentions** - Removed 23 mentions linked to these articles
3. **Delete articles** - Removed all 10 articles from database
4. **Clear cache** - In-memory cache cleared (Redis not enabled)
5. **Cleanup stale signals** - Removed 25 signal_scores with no mentions
6. **Cleanup orphaned mentions** - Removed 32 old mentions from previously deleted articles

## Prevention Measures

### Blacklist Active
Benzinga is already in the `BLACKLIST_SOURCES` in `rss_fetcher.py`:

```python
BLACKLIST_SOURCES = ['benzinga']
```

This prevents new Benzinga articles from being fetched and processed.

### Verification
```python
# From rss_fetcher.py line 90
articles = [a for a in articles if a.source.lower() not in BLACKLIST_SOURCES]
```

New Benzinga articles will be filtered out automatically during RSS feed processing.

## Impact Assessment

### UI Impact
- âœ… Signals cache cleared - UI will refresh on next request
- âœ… Trending entities recalculated without Benzinga data
- âœ… No more Benzinga articles in recent articles lists

### Data Integrity
- âœ… No orphaned entity_mentions remaining
- âœ… No stale signal_scores for deleted entities
- âœ… All related data properly cleaned up

### Performance
- âœ… Reduced database size (10 articles + 55 mentions removed)
- âœ… Cleaner signal calculations (25 stale signals removed)
- âœ… No impact on other sources or data

## Monitoring

### Check for New Benzinga Articles
```bash
poetry run python -c "
import asyncio
from src.crypto_news_aggregator.db.mongodb import mongo_manager, initialize_mongodb

async def check():
    await initialize_mongodb()
    db = await mongo_manager.get_async_database()
    count = await db.articles.count_documents({'source': 'benzinga'})
    print(f'Benzinga articles: {count}')
    await mongo_manager.aclose()

asyncio.run(check())
"
```

Should return: `Benzinga articles: 0`

### Verify Blacklist Working
Check RSS fetcher logs for:
```
ðŸš« Filtered out X articles from blacklisted sources: ['benzinga']
```
