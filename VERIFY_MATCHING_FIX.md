# Verify Narrative Matching Fix

## Purpose
Verify that the narrative actions backfill succeeded and that narratives now match correctly with populated `key_actions`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# After running backfill_narrative_actions.py
python3 scripts/verify_matching_fix.py
```

## What It Does

### Part 1: Backfill Verification
Queries the database to show:
1. **Total narratives count** - All narratives in database
2. **Count with populated key_actions** - Narratives with non-empty actions
3. **Percentage with actions** - Success rate of backfill
4. **Sample 5 narratives** - Shows fingerprints with actions

### Part 2: Matching Test (Last 24 Hours)
Re-runs matching logic for recent narratives:
1. Finds narratives from last 24 hours
2. Tests each narrative against candidates
3. Calculates similarity scores
4. Counts matches vs new narratives
5. Shows top 5 similarity scores

### Part 3: Before vs After Comparison
Compares results:
- **Match rate**: 0% (before) vs actual% (after)
- **Top similarity**: Previous best vs new best
- **Threshold analysis**: How many exceed 0.6
- **Distribution**: Excellent/Good/Poor scores

## Expected Output

## Understanding the Results

### Backfill Success
- **90%+ with actions**: Excellent - most narratives backfilled
- **70-90% with actions**: Good - some narratives may lack summaries
- **<70% with actions**: Poor - investigate why backfill failed

### Match Rate
- **>50% match rate**: Excellent - narratives merging well
- **30-50% match rate**: Good - reasonable deduplication
- **<30% match rate**: May need threshold adjustment

### Similarity Scores
- **‚â•0.8**: Excellent match - very similar narratives
- **0.6-0.8**: Good match - related narratives
- **<0.6**: Poor match - different narratives (correctly not matched)

## Interpreting Results

### Success Indicators
‚úÖ High percentage of narratives with actions (>80%)  
‚úÖ Match rate significantly above 0%  
‚úÖ Top similarity scores above 0.7  
‚úÖ Multiple narratives exceeding 0.6 threshold  

### Warning Signs
‚ö†Ô∏è Low percentage with actions (<50%)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Match rate still 0%  
‚ö†Ô∏è All similarity scores below 0.6  
‚ö†Ô∏è No narratives in "Excellent" range  

## Troubleshooting

### No Matches Found
**Possible reasons**:
1. Not enough narratives in last 24 hours
2. Narratives are genuinely different (good!)
3. Need more time for data accumulation

**Solution**: Wait for more narratives or extend time window

### Low Backfill Percentage
**Possible reasons**:
1. Many narratives lack summaries
2. API errors during backfill
3. Backfill script didn't complete

**Solution**: 
- Check backfill logs
- Re-run backfill script
- Investigate narratives without summaries

### Low Similarity Scores
**Possible reasons**:
1. Narratives are genuinely diverse
2. Actions not descriptive enough
3. Threshold may be too high

**Solution**:
- Review sample fingerprints
- Consider threshold adjustment
- Check action quality

## Technical Details

### Matching Logic
The script uses the same matching logic as production:
```python
from crypto_news_aggregator.services.narrative_service import find_matching_narrative
from crypto_news_aggregator.services.narrative_themes import calculate_fingerprint_similarity
```

### Similarity Calculation
```python
# Weighted scoring:
# - Actor overlap (Jaccard): 50% weight
# - Nucleus match (exact):   30% weight  
# - Action overlap (Jaccard): 20% weight
# Threshold: 0.6 (60% similarity)
```

### Time Window
- **Backfill verification**: All narratives
- **Matching test**: Last 24 hours only
- **Candidate search**: 14 days lookback

## Next Steps After Verification

### If Successful (>50% match rate)
1. ‚úÖ Backfill is working
2. ‚úÖ Monitor ongoing matching
3. ‚úÖ Consider running narrative detection
4. ‚úÖ Check for reduced duplicates

### If Partially Successful (20-50% match rate)
1. Review sample matches
2. Check action quality
3. Consider threshold tuning
4. Monitor over longer period

### If Unsuccessful (<20% match rate)
1. Review backfill logs
2. Check narrative summaries
3. Verify API key is working
4. Consider re-running backfill
