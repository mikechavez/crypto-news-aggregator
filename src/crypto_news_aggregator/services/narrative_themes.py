    Uses weighted scoring to determine if two narratives should be merged:

    - Actor overlap (Jaccard similarity of top_actors): weight 0.1

    with weighted scoring. If neither matches, returns 0.0 immediately.

Given the following article, describe:

1. The main *actors* (people, organizations, protocols, assets, regulators)
   - For each actor, assign a salience score from 1-5:
     * 5 = central protagonist of the story (the article is ABOUT this entity)
     * 4 = key participant (actively involved in the main events)
     * 3 = secondary participant (mentioned with some relevance)
     * 2 = supporting context (provides background but not central)
     * 1 = passing mention (could remove without changing story)
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Only include actors with salience >= 2 in your final list.
   Background mentions (salience 1) should be excluded.

2. **Nucleus entity** (required): The ONE entity this article is primarily about.
   This is the anchor of the story - if you had to summarize in one word, which entity?

3. **Narrative focus** (required): A 2-5 word phrase describing WHAT IS HAPPENING.
   This captures the core development/claim of the story, NOT the entity itself.
   Examples: "price surge", "regulatory enforcement", "protocol upgrade", "governance dispute",
   "ETF approval", "hack investigation", "partnership announcement", "market manipulation probe"

   The focus should be:
   - Verb-driven (captures action/development)
   - Specific enough to distinguish parallel stories about the same entity
   - General enough to merge related articles
   - NOT just the entity name or topic label (avoid "Dogecoin news" or "Bitcoin update")

5. The main *actions or events* (what happened)

6. The *forces or tensions* at play (e.g., regulation vs innovation, centralization vs decentralization)

7. The *implications* or *stakes* (why it matters)

Then summarize in 2-3 sentences what broader narrative this article contributes to.

**CRITICAL - ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:**
1. ONLY extract information explicitly stated in the article
2. Do NOT add titles or roles from your training knowledge
3. Do NOT assume someone is CEO, Chairman, etc. - people change positions
4. If the article says "CZ" without a title, just use "CZ" - don't add "Binance CEO"
5. Focus on WHAT happened, not assumptions about who holds what position

**ENTITY NORMALIZATION GUIDELINES:**

1. **Normalize entity names to canonical forms:**
   - "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission" → "SEC"
   - "Securities and Exchange Commission" → "SEC"
   - "US SEC" → "SEC"
   - "Ethereum Foundation" → "Ethereum"
   - "Ethereum network" → "Ethereum"
   - "Tether Holdings Limited" → "Tether"
   - "Tether USDT" → "Tether"
   - "Bitcoin Core developers" → "Bitcoin"
   - "Bitcoin network" → "Bitcoin"
   - "Binance.US" → "Binance" (unless US distinction is critical to the story)
   - "Binance exchange" → "Binance"
   - Always use the shortest, most recognizable form
   - Use common abbreviations (SEC, ETF, DeFi) not full names
   - For cryptocurrencies, use the name not ticker (Bitcoin not BTC, Ethereum not ETH)
   - For people: use their name only, NOT their title (e.g., "CZ" not "Binance CEO CZ")

2. **Nucleus entity selection rules:**
   - If multiple entities have salience 5, choose the one most directly responsible for the main action
   - Prefer specific entities over generic categories ("Binance" not "crypto exchanges")
   - Prefer actors over objects in regulatory stories ("SEC" not "lawsuit" or "regulation")
   - Prefer companies/organizations over people ("Coinbase" not "Brian Armstrong" unless person is the focus)
   - The nucleus should be the grammatical subject of the article's main action

3. **Salience scoring consistency:**
   - Reserve salience 5 for 1-2 entities maximum (the true protagonists)
   - Use salience 4 for 2-4 key participants
   - Use salience 3 for 3-6 secondary participants
   - Avoid giving everything high salience - be selective
   - Background mentions like "Bitcoin" or "crypto market" in passing should be excluded (salience 1)
