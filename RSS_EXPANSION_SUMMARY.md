### Total: 13 RSS Feeds

## Feeds with Technical Issues

The following feeds were tested but excluded due to technical problems:

### Research & Analysis
- **Delphi Digital** (https://members.delphidigital.io/feed): Malformed XML, may require subscription
- **Bankless** (https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/feed): SSL certificate hostname mismatch
- **Galaxy Research** (https://www.galaxy.com/feed/): XML syntax error, may require subscription

### DeFi-Focused
- **DefiLlama** (https://defillama.com/news/rss): Returns HTML instead of XML
- **Dune Blog** (https://dune.com/blog/rss): Malformed XML

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Added `test_rss_service_has_correct_feed_count()` to verify:
  - Correct number of feeds (10)
  - All expected sources are present
  - All URLs are valid HTTP/HTTPS strings

### Test Results
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/background/test_rss_fetcher.py::test_rss_service_has_correct_feed_count -v
# ✅ PASSED
```

### Integration Testing
The RSS fetcher can be tested with:
```bash
poetry run python scripts/test_rss_fetch.py
```

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
1. **src/crypto_news_aggregator/services/rss_service.py**
   - Added 6 new RSS feed URLs
   - Documented problematic feeds with comments

2. **tests/background/test_rss_fetcher.py**
   - Added import for `RSSService`
   - Added `test_rss_service_has_correct_feed_count()` test

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] Feature branch created: `feature/expand-rss-sources`
- [x] Code changes implemented
- [x] Tests added and passing
- [x] Changes committed with conventional commit message
- [ ] PR created and reviewed
- [ ] Merged to main
- [ ] Deployed to Railway

### Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, verify:
1. RSS fetcher runs without errors
2. Articles appear from new sources (check `source` field in database)
3. Monitor Railway logs for any feed parsing errors
4. Check article count increases appropriately

### Expected Behavior
- RSS fetcher will attempt to fetch from all 10 sources
- Working feeds will successfully parse and store articles
- Failed feeds will log errors but not crash the fetcher
- Each article will have a `source` field matching the feed name

## Future Improvements

1. **Fix Problematic Feeds**: Investigate and resolve issues with the 6 excluded feeds
2. **Feed Health Monitoring**: Add metrics to track which feeds are successfully fetching
3. **Subscription Feeds**: Investigate if Delphi Digital and Galaxy require authentication
4. **Feed Validation**: Add automated testing to detect feed issues before deployment
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for feeds that may have restrictions
