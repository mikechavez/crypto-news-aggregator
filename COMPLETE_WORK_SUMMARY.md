# Entity Normalization - Complete Work Summary

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented and deployed entity normalization system to merge ticker variants (BTC, $BTC, btc) into canonical names (Bitcoin). This improves signal accuracy by combining all variant mentions and provides consistent entity tracking across the crypto news aggregator.

**Status**: ✅ Fully Deployed to Production  
**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Impact**: 120 entity mentions normalized, 80 duplicates merged, 50 signals recalculated

---

## Problem Statement

### Initial Issue
The system was tracking cryptocurrency entities inconsistently:
- "Bitcoin", "BTC", "$BTC", "btc" were treated as separate entities
- Signal calculations fragmented across variants
- Duplicate entity mentions in database
- Inconsistent entity names in UI
- Reduced signal accuracy due to split mention counts

### Business Impact
- **Inaccurate Signals**: Bitcoin mentions split across 4+ variants
- **Poor UX**: Users saw "BTC" and "Bitcoin" as different entities
- **Data Duplication**: Same entity mentioned multiple times per article
- **Reduced Insights**: Trending detection missed combined signal strength

---

## Solution Design

### Architecture Overview

1. **Normalization Service**: Central mapping of variants to canonical names
2. **LLM Integration**: Automatic normalization during entity extraction
3. **Migration System**: One-time normalization of existing data
4. **Signal Recalculation**: Update signals to use canonical grouping

### Key Components

#### 1. Entity Normalization Service
**File**: `src/crypto_news_aggregator/services/entity_normalization.py`

**Features**:
- Canonical mappings for 50+ cryptocurrencies
- Case-insensitive variant matching
- Support for tickers ($BTC) and full names (Bitcoin)
- Helper functions for validation and lookup

**Mapping Structure**:
```python
ENTITY_MAPPING = {
    "Bitcoin": ["BTC", "$BTC", "btc", "bitcoin", "Bitcoin"],
    "Ethereum": ["ETH", "$ETH", "eth", "ethereum", "Ethereum"],
    "Solana": ["SOL", "$SOL", "sol", "solana", "Solana"],
    # ... 47 more cryptocurrencies
}
```

**Core Function**:
```python
def normalize_entity_name(entity_name: str) -> str:
    """Returns canonical name for any variant"""
    # BTC -> Bitcoin
    # $btc -> Bitcoin
    # bitcoin -> Bitcoin
```

#### 2. LLM Integration
**File**: `src/crypto_news_aggregator/llm/anthropic.py`

**Implementation**:
- Added import: `from ..services.entity_normalization import normalize_entity_name`
- Applied normalization after JSON parsing in `extract_entities_batch()`
- Normalizes both primary and context entities
- Normalizes entity names and ticker fields
- Added debug logging for normalized results

**Flow**:
1. LLM extracts entities (may return "BTC", "$BTC", "Bitcoin")
2. Normalization applied to all extracted entities
3. All variants converted to "Bitcoin"
4. Normalized entities saved to database

#### 3. Migration Script
**File**: `scripts/migrate_entity_normalization.py`

**Features**:
- Dry-run mode for safe preview
- Two-phase migration (entity_mentions + articles)
- Duplicate detection and merging
- Confidence score preservation
- Detailed statistics reporting
- User confirmation for live mode

**Migration Process**:
1. Load all entity mentions grouped by article
2. Normalize entity names using canonical mapping
3. Detect duplicates (same canonical name + type + article)
4. Merge duplicates, keeping highest confidence
5. Update entity_mentions collection
6. Delete duplicate records
7. Normalize entities in articles collection
8. Deduplicate article entities

#### 4. Signal Recalculation Script
**File**: `scripts/recalculate_signals.py`

**Purpose**: Recalculate all entity signals after migration to ensure accurate grouping

**Process**:
1. Get all unique entities from entity_mentions (primary only)
2. Calculate signal score for each entity
3. Update entity_signals collection
4. Progress reporting every 10 entities

## Technical Findings

### Normalization Patterns

**Most Common Normalizations**:
1. Ticker to full name: BTC → Bitcoin, ETH → Ethereum
2. Dollar prefix removal: $BTC → Bitcoin, $ETH → Ethereum
3. Case normalization: btc → Bitcoin, ethereum → Ethereum
4. Variant unification: bitcoin → Bitcoin

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Empty strings return empty
- None values return None
- Unknown entities return unchanged
- Case-insensitive matching works correctly

### Database Impact

**Entity Mentions Collection**:
- Before: 525 documents
- After: 445 documents (80 duplicates removed)
